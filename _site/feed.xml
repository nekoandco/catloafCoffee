<h2 id="august">August</h2>

<p>I follow Luna up an array of escalators to a chic diner on the sixth floor of the train station. Through its glass facade, I can see walls painted in neutral hues, booths paired with cold steel tables, and exposed-bulb lighting dangling from the ceiling. Large windows bathe everything in warm sunlight. Trendy. She has good taste.</p>

<p>We’ve come during the lunch rush, but fortune has smiled upon us today as we’re ushered into the last empty booth. Luna slides into the far side and I slide in across from her. She looks good. Rings adorn her fingers and the bouncy black curls that hover above her eyes match her all-black attire. I do not look good, however. I’m dressed in white baggy pants and a T-shirt. There couldn’t be a starker contrast between us.</p>

<p>I had laser done on my face a couple of days ago, resulting in my face becoming dark and bumpy, and leaving me feeling ugly and dysphoric. Today’s amorphous outfit is the uniform I’ve settled into this week, hoping to cover up as much of myself as I possibly can in an effort to not be seen as a man or a woman or really even a person. This is rather embarrassing in front of Luna, though.</p>

<p>I reach for a menu, even though I already know exactly what I’m going to order. I always research restaurants ahead of time: what’s on the menu, how to order, how to pay, and so on. This way, there are no surprises, which is good because surprises are bad. They lead to stress and stress leads to overwhelm and overwhelm leads to me acting in strange ways that people don’t seem to like.</p>

<p>I hope to impress Luna, and to do that I think I need to appear somewhat normal. A tall order, but I’m willing to give it a shot. I pretend to peruse the menu thoughtfully. It seems like the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Today is our first time meeting in person. We had talked a little online, but only a little, mostly about topics unrelated to ourselves. I wasn’t sure what to expect after she messaged me out of the blue inviting me for lunch, but as soon I sat down in her passenger seat this morning and saw her face for the first time, I realized I had made a severe miscalculation.</p>

<p>The possibility that she could be pretty never crossed my mind. Not that trans women can’t be pretty, plenty are, but in all my scripting of our impending encounter I never prepared for what to do if she were pretty. And she’s not just a little pretty, she’s <em>really</em> pretty. I can’t take my eyes off her. This is a surprise, and we were supposed to have of none of those today, and now I’m doing strange things like pretending to study a menu that I have burned into memory.</p>

<p>After a little while, Luna asks if I’m ready to order and I say yes. I order a Neapolitan spaghetti<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and she orders some veggie thing. An awkward silence follows, which means that I must be bombing this social interaction because a long time ago I got it in my head that I am destined to carry the entire weight of any conversation I’m ever a part of. It’s not you, it’s me. It’s <em>always</em> me.</p>

<p>I need to say something, so I ask about her hobbies—<em>oh, you play guitar?</em>—but I barely hear her answer because I’m preoccupied with making appropriate eye-contact. If I look at her then I become completely dumbstruck by her beauty, but if I don’t make eye contact then she will think I hate her. I must thread the needle. Enough eye-contact to seem interested, but not too much that it gets weird.</p>

<p>My efforts are a miserable failure. She’s so easy to look at, <em>too</em> easy, so I settle for a middle-ground: I’ll just look at her hands. This way, I can look at her without <em>looking</em> at her. Brilliant! They don’t call me Sage for nothing.</p>

<p>The good news is I’m not totally inept at conversation. I’m pretty great at the part where the other person talks and I listen. It’s easy! I just keep asking questions and it seems like I’m a good conversationalist. If the person likes to yap, we get along swell.</p>

<p>But god forbid they ask <em>me</em> a question. How dare they! I give weird, ramble-y answers and half-truths while I franticly try to move the spotlight away from me. My favorite tactic is to mention something that I like, and then ask <em>do you like it, too?</em> and if they say yes, I ask them to tell me about it and then—<em>bam!</em>—I’ve shifted the role of speaker back to them. It works more often than not.</p>

<p>I’m often told I’m a bit of a mystery, and it’s probably because I hate talking about myself. While I can write about myself at length, the moment things enter the verbal space it’s different somehow. I’m not good at forming thoughts quickly, so people think I’m slow or confused. Really, I just need a little more time to think of what to say and how to say it, but rarely am I ever afforded that time.</p>

<p>Luckily, today I have plenty of time to think, but I can’t think of anything to say. Luna asks about my hobbies and I swear I have those, but I can’t recall what they could be. Her gaze is disorienting. It turns my mind to mush. Butterflies swirl in my stomach and I feel a warmth stirring further below. I feel like I’m in high school again. Gross.</p>

<p>Although, maybe it’s kind of nice…</p>

<p>Snap to. Focus. I tell her I listen to a lot of 90s rock.</p>

<p>“Just 90s rock?” she asks.</p>

<p>I say yes. Stupid. So stupid. It’s not even true, but I said it anyway because I couldn’t think of anything else to say. The worst part is, I can’t tell whether she’s onto my ruse or not. She probably is. She’s probably regretting inviting me out to lunch in the first place.</p>

<p>Her plate is nearly clean and I’ve barely eaten one-third of my spaghetti. She notices this and asks in a sad voice, “Oh, is the food not good?”</p>

<p>“No,” I say. “It’s great, I’m just not hungry.” Another lie and my stomach betrays me, rumbling in protest. The food is genuinely delicious, but I can’t get myself to eat in front of her. What if I eat weirdly?</p>

<p>We pay for our meal and walk through the station to her car. Brief bouts of small-talk and awkward silence make up our car ride. By the time she drops me off at my place, I’m sure she’ll never want to see me again.</p>

<p>I’m used to this feeling. Another botched first impression. Nothing to do but ruminate about it for the next few weeks.</p>

<h2 id="september">September</h2>

<p>A long carpeted hallway stretches out before me, and a plain white door stands at its end. Yellow fluorescent lights run along the ceiling and at least a dozen people line the walls. Each of them stare at me, wide-eyed with lifeless smiles plastered across their faces. They look at me expectantly.</p>

<p>I don’t know why, but I must enter that door. It’s important. As I begin my approach, I’m greeted by the figure nearest me. “Hi, █████! How are you?” it says in a cheery voice. I’m stunned. How do they even know that name? No one calls me that anymore. I shrug it off and continue toward the door. The next figure addresses me.  “Hey, █████!” it chirps. “I was just thinking about you!” There’s that name again. I turn to them and inform them that my name is Sage. They silently stare back at me, their smile never breaking. What the hell?</p>

<p>I hurry down the corridor. I don’t look over my shoulder, but I can feel everyone’s gaze boring a hole into the back of my head. With each figure passed, another greeting: “█████, it’s been a while!” “Morning, █████! Fine weather we’re having.” “Oh my god, █████? Long time no see!”</p>

<p>“Sage! My name is Sage!” I shout at them, but they do not relent. At last, I arrive at the door and quickly slip inside.</p>

<p>I find myself in a packed courtroom and I’m in the defendant’s seat. It’s quiet. My mother sits in the judge’s seat, dressed in black robes and gavel in hand. Everyone seems to be waiting for me to say something. No, not just anything—they’re waiting for me to explain myself. They want to see me beg.</p>

<p>“I’m not that person anymore,” I plead. “I’m Sage! I’m a woman.” My voice cracks.</p>

<p>The judge snickers, cutting me off. “He really thinks he’s a girl!” she sneers. “He thinks he can put on makeup and grow his hair out and that makes him a woman.”</p>

<p>The courtroom erupts in laughter and begins to chant. <em>Tranny, tranny!</em> They point at me and hold their bellies, unable to contain themselves.</p>

<p>“Why are you doing this?” I ask. My voice sounds distorted, shifted a couple of octaves lower. “Why are you doing this to me?” Tears rush down my cheeks as their cackling grows louder and louder.</p>

<p><em>Tranny, tranny!</em></p>

<p>It’s deafening. My ears are about to burst. It’s the loudest sound I’ve ever heard.</p>

<p><em>Tranny, tranny!</em></p>

<p>Their chortles morph into a regular rhythm and its pitch alters to a monotone digital screech. I shoot up from my futon in a cold sweat.</p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-beans.png" /></div>

<p>The workday is a blur. I had a few classes today and I numbly felt my way through them. The morning’s haunting really got under my skin, and I’ve been dissociating like I used to before I started hormones.</p>

<p>During our lunch break, Michelle senses something is off and asks if I’m feeling alright. I tell her no and recount my dream. She offers sympathy as best she can, then changes the topic.</p>

<p>“You remember those guys we met at the festival last weekend?” she asks.</p>

<p>I think for a moment. “From your Japanese class?”</p>

<p>She nods.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I remember.”</p>

<p>“Well, they were asking about you. I think they thought you were going to start coming with me or something.” She looks at me with a slight smile. “Anyway, they really thought you were a girl!”</p>

<p>They really thought I’m a girl? <em>I am</em> a girl. Why should it be surprising that anyone thinks I’m a girl? Of course, I know the answer. But still.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is <em>obviously</em> a fake story.</p>

<p>“Nah, I can’t believe that,” I say, shaking my head. “I won’t.”</p>

<p>She looks at me with a puzzled expression. “What? Why?”</p>

<p>“I talked to them. They heard my voice. And I know what I look like. There’s <em>no way</em> they think I’m a girl.”</p>

<p>“I’m telling you, they do. They were asking about ‘that girl’ from the other night.” She pauses. “You looked good. You had your makeup done really nice!”</p>

<p>“That’s true, I tried really hard, actually…” my voice trails off. “But it was dark out.”</p>

<p>“Okay,” she says with a hand wave. “Whatever you say.”</p>

<p>I’m not an idiot. I’m still in my first year of transition. There is simply no way anyone is reading me as a woman. I don’t pass, and I’m not going to delude myself into thinking I’m anything but clocky. Assuming this was a true story, these people were being nice at best. And hey, good for them—<em>yay allies!</em>—but they knew. There’s no way they didn’t know.</p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-paws.png" /></div>

<p>At the end of our session, a familiar awkward silence creeps in. We only agreed to meet for (Japanese) tutoring, but it feels anticlimactic to part ways so soon after we both traveled quite a ways to meet. I want to ask Luna out for dinner, but I’m not sure if it’s appropriate to do so. I’m sort of her student now? The last thing I want to do is make it weird.</p>

<p>I study the floor like I’ve just made the next great archeological find, and then I hear a voice. “So,” she starts, “do you want to get dinner?”</p>

<p>I giggle. Maybe we’re on the same page, after all? “I was hoping you’d ask.”</p>

<p>She leads me to her car and I suggest we go for Thai, trying to accommodate her pescatarian diet. She agrees and turns on some rap music for the drive.</p>

<p>“So, you remember when I said I just listen to 90s music?” I ask.</p>

<p>“Mhm.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, so that was a lie,” I confess, nervously laughing. “I listen to a lot of different stuff, actually.”</p>

<p>She snickers. “What the hell, girl! Why?”</p>

<p>“I dunno, I guess I was nervous.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you <em>actually</em> listen to?”</p>

<p>“I <em>do</em> listen to a lot of 90s rock. But also other stuff. I’m really obsessing over Jane Remover right now. Know her?”</p>

<p>She nods. “Yeah, she’s cool.”</p>

<p>“Anyways, I feel like a made a bad first impression and…” My voice trails off.</p>

<p>She looks at me, her pretty face contorted in confusion. “What are you talking about? You were fine!”</p>

<p>“Yeah, well, I was just nervous. I’m not very good at meeting people and-“</p>

<p>“I don’t even know what you’re talking about.”</p>

<p>“-like, I couldn’t think of what to say. Anyway, sorry.” I let out a sigh.</p>

<p>“Okay. Well, that’s crazy,” she says dismissively. “If anyone made a bad first impression, it was me and my bad personality.”</p>

<p>I laugh. “I think your personality is great, personally.”</p>

<p>When we arrive at the restaurant, rain pours from above, making loud <em>pitter-patters</em> on the car roof. “Shit, I don’t have an umbrella,” Luna says.</p>

<p>“I’ve got one,” I say. “It’s kinda small, but we can make it work.” Huddling under my pink (of course) umbrella, we shuffle inside. I try to be normal about being so close to her.</p>

<p>I haven’t been here in a couple of years, not since the COVID days, but this place hasn’t changed a bit. There’s still a man that hobbles from behind the kitchen counter to sanitize our hands with a comically oversized spray gun. The menus are still nonexistent, requiring us to scan a QR code to see what’s on offer. There’s still the two tables meant to seat two people each, that are barely big enough for one.</p>

<p>A woman greets us and motions for us to sit at the bar. She gestures toward the QR code on a laminated sheet of A4 paper and says, “When you two ladies are ready to order, let me know.”</p>

<p>What. Is. Happening. Before today, I’d never been referred to as a woman by a stranger, and now this is the second time it’s happened today. Is someone playing a joke on me? Get the tranny to think she passes, and when she starts to believe it, the walls fall down like in <em>Mission Impossible</em> to reveal an audience pointing and laughing at me like this morning? Very funny.</p>

<p>Well, I’m not falling for it. I’m sure that woman meant well, but the only way she knew that I’m a woman was by proxy. Luna is much closer to passing than I am, <em>and</em> she’s wearing a skirt. It’s just context clues. But she knew. <em>She knew.</em></p>

<p>I turn to Luna. “Did you hear that?” I ask.</p>

<p>“Hear what?” she says, not looking up from the menu on her phone.</p>

<p>“She called us ladies.”</p>

<p>“Hm?” She seems disinterested.</p>

<p>“Right before she walked off, she was like, ‘When <em>you two ladies</em> are ready, call me.’”</p>

<p>She shrugs. “Oh, huh.”</p>

<p>Of course she doesn’t care. It doesn’t even phase her. She’s so pretty, she probably never gets misgendered. She’s only a few months ahead of me in her transition, but so much farther in results. It’s not fair. A part of me starts to resent her and her pretty privilege, but then I look back at her and am once again enamored with her beauty. How could I ever hate something so pretty?</p>

<p>Over dinner, conversation flows freely. Gone are the awkward silences and discomforts of a first-time meetup. Our discussion mostly centers around our transitions, which is to be expected. There are four trans people that I know of in our area, including myself. We don’t get very many opportunities for face-to-face t4t<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> here.</p>

<p>It’s cathartic talking about these things with someone who <em>gets it</em>. Inevitably, anytime I talk about trans topics with a cisgender person, I’m thrust into the role of educator. While it’s good to educate people that <em>actually there’s more than two genders and yes you can change your gender and no we don’t all have to get The Surgery and some of us don’t even want it anyway</em>, I’m usually left feeling more alone than before. Always having to explain my existence takes its toll, but with Luna I can simply <em>be</em>. It’s nice.</p>

<p>At the same time, I don’t want to talk about being trans with Luna. That seems like the least interesting thing right now. I know about being trans. I live it every day. But I don’t know Luna. Who is she? What’s her story?</p>

<p>But of course, put two trans girls together and they will talk about being trans girls. It’s simply the way of things. I go along with it, hoping that we can get to the topics I actually want to discuss further down the line.</p>

<p>After we finish our meal—this time, my plate is spotless—we huddle under my umbrella once more and skip over to her car. I tell her she can drop me off at the train station nearby.</p>

<p>“You live far away, though,” she rebuts.</p>

<p>“Yeah, but I took the bus here,” I say. “I’ll take it back.”</p>

<p>“I’ll just take you home.”</p>

<p>“Really?” I ask. We live nowhere close to one another.</p>

<p>“Yeah, it’s no problem,” she chirps. “It’s pouring rain out, anyway.”</p>

<p>Thirty minutes later, we pull up to my local bus stop, where my bike is parked. I still have a 15 minute bike ride ahead of me.</p>

<p>“Fuuuuck,” I moan. “It’s still raining.”</p>

<p>“We can wait,” Luna says, shrugging.</p>

<p>“No, it’s fine. It’s already kinda late and you’ve got a long drive to get home.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I’m unemployed.” It’s true. She’s starting a new job in a few weeks.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Yeah!”</p>

<p>We park in a nearby parking lot. I check the weather on my phone and it says the rain will let up in about 30 minutes. Luna reiterates that she doesn’t mind waiting, and our conversation from earlier resumes.</p>

<p>“You’re so strong,” she says. “I wish I were like you.”</p>

<p>I scoff. “I’m not strong,” I say.</p>

<p>“Yes you are. Coming out at work–I could never do that. No way.”</p>

<p>I look over at her, sat there in her feminine attire. Even on a good day, I never dress so femininely. I’m not brave enough, but she thinks that <em>I’m</em> strong? All my friends are mentally ill, I swear.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’m strong at all,” I say. “I didn’t have a choice. I was at a point where there were two paths in front of me: either I started transitioning, or I killed myself. Hardly a choice. But that’s where I was at: the end of the line. This was a last-ditch effort. I had nothing to lose. I mean, I could’ve lost my job, sure, but if the alternative was to kill myself, then it doesn’t really matter. You know?”</p>

<p>She nods softly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to come out at work. Or to anyone, really. I hate transitioning in front of everyone. It feels, I dunno, <em>violating</em>. It’s the most personal experience of my life—there’s almost a spiritual element to it and I’m not a spiritual person at all—yet I have to do this in front of everyone. The whole world is witness to me as I change. I wish I could go away for a few years, like off in the mountains or something, and transition and then come down from the mountain, a new woman.”</p>

<p>She smiles. “Like I’m about to?” Luna’s new job is far away in the mountains.</p>

<p>I laugh. “Yeah, like you’re about to do, I suppose.”</p>

<p>I look out the window. The rain has stopped and it’s past ten. I have work in the morning. I tell Luna I should probably head home. Just as I’m about to open the passenger door, she stops me.</p>

<p>“Hey, so, um,” she starts, then briefly pauses. “If you still wanna meet up to tutor again, let me know.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, for s-“ I begin.</p>

<p>“And we should definitely get dinner again,” she says, smiling at me. “I had a really good time.”</p>

<p>My cheeks feel warm and I beam back at her. “Absolutely.”</p>

<p>I bike home, throw myself onto my futon, and stare at the ceiling with a dumb smile stretched across my face. I haven’t felt these feelings in a very long time, but it’s nice to feel them again.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday">Wednesday</h2>

<p>The barista hands me a latte and I saunter over to a small table snugly tucked into a nook at the back of the coffee shop. I nearly scald my tongue on the coffee as I absentmindedly scroll on my phone while I wait for Luna to arrive for our tutoring session. After about ten minutes, I spy a woman dressed in black approach my table. Bingo.</p>

<p>“Hey,” she says with a smile.</p>

<p>“Hey,” I say, smiling back at her.</p>

<p>We get to work. I ask her about some grammar rules and she explains them. I take notes and inquire further. She continues to explain, but I notice that she seems a little frustrated by my string of questioning.</p>

<p>Right. I’ve made my first mistake of the night. People don’t like it when they’re asked too many questions, especially if they’re asked a bunch of questions about the same thing. They start to think that they’re being fucked with, or maybe the person asking is just plain stupid. I don’t want Luna thinking either of these things about me.</p>

<p>“Sorry. I understand what you’re saying, but I’m just trying to make sure I get it exactly right,” I clarify. “Japanese grammar is kinda difficult sometimes, y’know? When I studied it back in uni, I didn’t feel like I really learned the rules around any of the grammar. I just kinda operated on vibes, which probably isn’t ideal. Like, our classes were full-immersion from the very beginning, so if you didn’t understand something you were kind of fucked because you had to ask in Japanese, but none of our Japanese abilities were at a level where we could ask for clarification, y’know? So anyway, I’m not trying to be difficult. I think I understand this stuff, but I want to make sure.”</p>

<p>A long-winded apology for something that I shouldn’t be apologizing for in the first place—<em>classic Sage</em>.</p>

<p>“I think maybe I’m just not explaining it well,” she says, looking defeated.</p>

<p>Great, now I made the cute girl sad.</p>

<p>“No, not at all!” I cry. “Your explanations make sense. Some more examples would useful, though.”</p>

<p>She resumes her explanation, and I watch her intently so she knows I’m paying close attention. Despite her frustration, I can tell she’s passionate about this stuff from the way her eyes light up, the way her curls bounce as she moves, how her lips move as she speaks… Suddenly, I’m in a house—our house—in the kitchen with Luna. She smiles at me and whispers something in my ear. I lean over and kiss her cheek, then she pulls me close and-</p>

<p>Christ, Sage. This is pathetic. <em>Focus.</em></p>

<p>I return to the coffee shop just as she’s finishing her explanation, which I realize I didn’t hear a bit of. Luna asks me if I understand, and I smile and nod.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I think I really get it now,” I lie cheerfully. “Thank you!” <em>Idiot.</em></p>

<p>Soon, our session comes to an end. “Shall we get dinner?” I ask.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” she replies. “Where do you want to go?”</p>

<p>“Dunno,” I respond coyly. “Whatever sounds good to you.”</p>

<p>“Hmm. I’m actually not all that hungry.”</p>

<p>My heart sinks. Was it the questions? Did I really ask too many?</p>

<p>“But…” she says, and her voice trails off. “We could just go back to my place and watch a movie, or something? We could stop and get some food at a <em>konbini</em> along the way.”</p>

<p>Oh my god. Am I blushing? I’m definitely blushing right now.</p>

<p>“Yeah, that sounds perfect!” I say, trying to keep my cool.</p>

<p>“Okay,” she whispers.</p>

<p>Luna lives a little over 30 minutes away, and our car ride is strangely silent. I try a few conversation topics but she doesn’t seem interested in talking. It’s odd. I thought after our last encounter we had finally broken the ice.</p>

<p>She stops at a konbini and we grab some food, then we arrive at her place. It’s mostly empty because she’s moving in a few days.</p>

<p>We eat dinner on a tiny table in her otherwise empty living room. It might feel warm and intimate if we weren’t completely silent. Instead, it’s so awkward it’s almost painful.</p>

<p>I know what to do. I prepared a line for just this sort of situation. It’s sure to lead us to a night filled of rich conversation.</p>

<p>“So, I know Luna the trans girl,” I say, nearly startled at the sound of my voice cutting through the silence. “But I don’t know <em>Luna</em>.”</p>

<p>Admittedly, this sounded much better in my head. Hearing it aloud, it sounds like one of the dumbest things to have ever come out of my mouth—and that’s no easy feat.</p>

<p>“I… don’t know what that means,” she says slowly, staring into her bowl of ramen.</p>

<p>I start to sweat. “I mean, we’ve talked a lot about our transitions and all of that. But I don’t know much about <em>you</em>, who you are, what makes you tick.”</p>

<p>“I… I dunno,” she mumbles, shrugging as she slurps a noodle.</p>

<p>Normally, this works. At least, this works with my other friends. I can be direct with them and we get along swimmingly. Then again, I’m pretty sure all of my friends are neurodivergent in some capacity, and my Autism radar isn’t picking anything up on Luna. I regret to say it, but I think she might be neurotypical.</p>

<p>If she is neurotypical, there’s almost certainly no hope for us. We’re forever doomed to never truly understand one another. My fantasies of us start to crack and crumble. The inherent understanding we had in our shared transness is now limited by my neurodivergence.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m wrong, though. I cling to this hope as we finish dinner and move upstairs to watch a movie. As I start to climb the stairs, Luna turns to me and motions toward the bag of popcorn in my hand. “So, actually, I don’t want you to eat anything up here because it’s <em>washitsu</em>,” she says. “It’s got tatami mats on the floor.”</p>

<p>Okay. This is somewhat understandable because tatami is difficult to clean and she’s just about to move out. Although, this is more than a little odd because I offered to share my popcorn with her at the konbini and she just nodded. But fine, it’s her house.</p>

<p>“Oh, yeah, no worries,” I say. I leave the popcorn on the table.</p>

<p>She continues up the stairs, then turns toward me again. “Oh, and I don’t want you drinking anything up there, either,” she says flatly.</p>

<p>I look down at the Coke bottle in my hand. Damn, we can’t have anything in this house! What kind of place is this?</p>

<p>“Right. Yeah, no problem,” I reply, trying to mask my frustration. “Can I put my Coke in your fridge, then?”</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s fine,” she says. “Just don’t forget it when you leave.”</p>

<p><em>What the fuck?</em> Did I do something? Did I say something? I can accept that I might’ve said or did something a little strange, but I can’t think of anything that would lead her to suddenly treat me so coldly. This Luna is different from the one I met with before. Maybe she’s stressed with the move, but she seemed fine earlier. Come to think of it, she started acting strangely as soon as I accepted her invitation over here.</p>

<p>We spend the next two hours watching a movie in near total silence. She sits me on one end of the room, while she lays down on the other, behind a table set between us so that I can’t see any part of her. Any ideas I might’ve had of something akin to Netflix and chill are swiftly put to rest.</p>

<p>As the movie plays, I replay the past two hours in my mind. If I did something, I can’t think of what it could be. I’m supposed to be the awkward one, but it seems the other way around tonight. I’m rather peeved. I had really been looking forward to tonight, but this whole experience is simply uncomfortable. I feel like I’m intruding, like I’m bothering her, like she doesn’t like me, but she was the one who invited me over in the first place. I don’t want to be here anymore. I want to go home.</p>

<p>After the film ends, Luna starts to warm back up. She’s more chatty now but I’m over it. I don’t understand what is going on with her, but I’m keenly aware that I have spent my entire night on whatever this is. It’s also quite late, I still have to get home, and I have work in the morning. I don’t want to be a bitch, though. I decide to give Luna one last shot. I play along with her game for now.</p>

<p>She asks me about a personality test and I tell her my type: I’m an “<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality">Architect</a>,” which reads like a long-winded description of a high-masking Autistic person. I ask her personality type and pull up its description on my phone. I read some of the highlights aloud, lightly poking fun at its claims. Personality tests are nonsense, right?</p>

<p>Luna sits up and looks at me. “You have to be careful how you word things around me,” she says sternly, “because I will intentionally take it in the worst way possible.”</p>

<p>Well, shit. I guess I really fucked this one. She gets quiet and I reciprocate. I’m not even sure what was offensive about what I said. In fact, I was so convinced of its inoffensive nature that I can’t even recall what I said. Luna has never given me the impression that she’s sensitive in this way. She’s a trans woman, and sure, we’re all sensitive to a certain extent, but Luna never seemed like someone I needed to be careful around.</p>

<p>I ruminate on this for a while as we sit in silence. After a while, I say I should probably get home and we go downstairs to her car. She compliments my shoes on the way, which confuses me. I’m wearing black slip-on Vans, and who the hell is impressed by those? She may as well have complimented me for liking vanilla ice cream.</p>

<p>In the car, Luna streams punk music from her phone. The familiar midwestern emo vocals remind me of times I’d rather forget. She’s loudly singing along. It’s awkward, but at least we aren’t withering away in silence.</p>

<p>“Hey, listen,” I say in a gentle voice, and Luna lowers the volume. “I’m sorry if I said something that really upset you. That wasn’t my intention, like at all, and-“</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” she interrupts.</p>

<p>“Well, you said I have to be careful about the way I word things around you-”</p>

<p>“Oh my god, no, no, no…”</p>

<p>“-and I mean, I thought I said something that upset you. I know I can come off kinda strong sometimes, and I’ve had problems like this before in the past, and like, I struggle with my tone because I’m Autistic, but I don’t want you to feel-”</p>

<p>“Did you listen to everything I said?”</p>

<p>“What? Um…” I’m confused.</p>

<p>“I said after that, that I’d intentionally take it in the worst way possible,” she says, as if this is supposed to mean something to me.</p>

<p>“Yeah, so…?”</p>

<p>“Girl, I was joking! I said I would <em>intentionally</em> take it the worst way. I was joking! Oh my god, Sage.”</p>

<p>I don’t understand the joke. I have friends with whom I must be cautious how I word my statements around because they actually will take everything as criticism. How am I supposed to know this was a joke? I was genuinely concerned. I thought I hurt her, but she’s acting like I’m being dumb and dramatic. I feel stupid: stupid for caring, stupid for apologizing, and stupid for ever crushing over this girl.</p>

<p>“Fine,” I spit. “I take it back. I’m not sorry.” I try to play this off with a playful energy, but inside I’m seething.</p>

<p>She laughs and says, “Sage, I think you’re too normal for me.”</p>

<p>That’s a first. I’ve been building a long list of interpersonal issues over the years, and I’ve been called many things but never “normal.” I’m starting to think maybe this girl isn’t so normal herself.</p>

<p>I laugh bitterly. “Yeah, you know, I think you might be right,” I say as I look out the window.</p>

<p>I know what she means. She means boring. She’s trying to be nice about it, maybe, but she’s calling me boring. Years of being made fun of but never realizing it until weeks or months or years later has trained me to recognize when someone is saying one thing but meaning something entirely different. This, presumably, is the reason for all the weirdness tonight: I’m boring.</p>

<p>I count down the minutes until we arrive at my place while she continues belting out emo lyrics. What a waste of a perfectly good night. This crush is definitely <em>over</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-day-after">The day after</h2>

<p>“So I’m like, what the fuck did I do?” I exclaim a little too loudly. Now the shop owners can tell their friends about the weird femboy who shouted expletives in their yogurt shop. You’re welcome for the story, I guess.</p>

<p>Michelle pokes at her yogurt bowl with a spoon. “Yeah…” she starts, her voice trailing off. Her face is scrunched up, like she can’t quite make sense of what I just told her. At least I’m not the only one that seems confused by whatever that was last night. “The only thing I can think of is maybe she got nervous after she invited you over?”</p>

<p>I roll my eyes. “Oh, grow up, bitch!” I blurt out and Michelle laughs. “Don’t invite someone over if you’re gonna get weird about it. She was totally fine up until she invited me!”</p>

<p>“Maybe it just hit her all at once, y’know?” Michelle shrugs. “I dunno. I can’t really say because I don’t know her.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, me neither.”</p>

<p>I sigh and turn to the window behind me. Raindrops streak down the glass as people strut by under umbrellas. Strange. I think I just caught a faint scent of pad thai.</p>

<p>I turn back to Michelle. “Honestly, I’m not that upset,” I say. “I’m more disappointed than upset. I can accept that maybe I missed a social cue or something. It happens. I’m used to it. I’m Autistic, y’know? It’s part of the deal.” I pause and scoop some yogurt into my mouth. “Maybe I misread the situation and she was never into me like I thought she was, but I would’ve been happy to just be friends, too. Sure, I was hoping for more than that, but I’m a big girl. I can settle for friendship, but last night wasn’t good for anyone, regardless of what they were hoping for. It was just… uncomfortable. Bad vibes.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Sage,” Michelle says. “I know you really liked her.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I did,” I mutter, and turn back toward the window. “I really did.”</p>

<p>Admittedly, I <em>was</em> a little angry last night. I felt led-on, insulted, and humiliated for ever thinking that maybe there was a deeper subtext to Luna and I’s meetings; that maybe she was looking for something a little more than just a casual meetup; that maybe, just maybe, someone else found <em>me</em> pretty. In hindsight, that was a ridiculous notion, especially considering Luna’s caliber. She’s so pretty. <em>Too</em> pretty for someone like me.</p>

<p>I’m spiraling and I know it, and the fact that last night was trigging for me only plunges me deeper into my psyche. Yes, I had a bad night, but it was just that: a bad night. Am I really so weak that I can’t handle <em>one</em> bad night? What’s wrong with me?</p>

<p>The clouds darken and plunge the street into early darkness, as the rain pours with an increased intensity. The passing cars’ headlights illuminate the rain streaking across the window, creating globs like misshapen Christmas lights. Another bite of yogurt and my stomach churns: I know what my problem is, but I don’t want to admit it. I fear that by directly acknowledging it, the issue will grow and fester completely beyond my control. But the jig is up. The attempted hoodwinking of my own psyche has been laid bare. There’s nothing left to do but admit to it.</p>

<p>Okay, here goes. This is the truth:</p>

<p>I believe that I am shit. My perspective and my experiences are not worthy of anyone’s time. My struggles do not matter because I do not matter. I am shit. I’ve never been happy because someone like me doesn’t deserve happiness. I am shit.</p>

<p>I struggle to see myself as pretty because I can’t see past the veneer of transness that coats my body. The harsh angles that define my face, the brow line that juts out from my skull, the facial hair that refuses to leave, the extremities that are unnaturally large for a woman—I see these things and feel like a monster. Luna possesses a similar veneer, albeit to a much lesser degree, yet I don’t struggle to see her as beautiful because she isn’t me. The rules are different for me. I am not kind to myself because I am not enough. I am shit.</p>

<p>I struggle with conversation because I refuse to talk about myself, leaving conversations one-sided. I am perceived as not interested in others because I close myself off from them. This isn’t because of Autism, not really. Autism certainly shapes and informs the way that I interact with others and the world at large, but the true reason I struggle to interact with others is because I cannot reconcile with the idea that anyone could possibly be interested in me. In a world inhabited by over 8 billion people, why the hell would anyone choose me? I am boring. I am shit.</p>

<p>In the few relationships I do have, I struggle with ever seeing myself as worthy of them. I am distrustful of anyone who acts as if they like me. No one could possibly like me; therefore they must be up to something. They want something from me, or they’re making fun of me—whatever it is they are plotting, it surely must be nefarious because there is no way that anyone would ever want to include me in their lives. I am worthless. I am shit.</p>

<p>When I am disregarded, ignored, invalidated, or abused I become angry, but ultimately accept that I deserve these things happening to me because <em>I am shit</em>. Above all, there is one fundamental truth that lies at the core of my world view: I am undeserving of love or respect.</p>

<p>I believe these things because I have been conditioned to believe them. I see myself as a monster because that is what I’ve been told trans women are. I see myself as boring and difficult because that is how Autistic people are portrayed.</p>

<p>People like me are made to feel like mentally ill abominations, good for nothing but sucking air and taking up precious space. We’re told we are confused, incapable of deciding for ourselves who we are; that we’re predators, that we’ve fallen from the graces of God and therefore we are irredeemable. We’re called slurs by those even in the upper echelons of our governments. We’re told we’ll never amount to anything worthwhile; that we’re an embarrassment; that we’re wrong, inherently, and that we must be fixed. And if we can’t be fixed, then we should be eradicated entirely.</p>

<p>I have held these beliefs for as long as I can remember. Logically, I know they are incorrect but my heart does not operate on logic.</p>

<p>It’s no wonder Luna declared me “normal.” These beliefs have whitewashed my personality: I <em>am</em> boring, not fundamentally, but by choice. Boring is inoffensive. It’s safe.</p>

<p>I am so entrenched in my own self-hatred that I can’t see two feet in front of me. How can I ever expect anyone to love me if I am unable to love myself? How can I ever expect to love myself if I spend all my time degrading myself?</p>

<p>Suicide has been at the forefront of my mind since before I even knew what that word meant. I remember taking walks around the neighborhood with my mother when I was in elementary school, and the whole time I would think about not existing; not having a body, or even a brain. To simply fade away into nothingness. To be free. I desired this more than anything in the world.</p>

<p>Fantasies of death have drifted about in my mind in the years since, and I would be lying if I said their promises of release aren’t enticing. To be free of all the stress, despair, transphobia, sensory overwhelm, social difficulties—to be free of the violence I inflict upon myself would be the ultimate liberation. In oblivion, I would be neither worthless nor have any worth. Serenity via nonexistence.</p>

<p>For my entire adult life, I have viewed suicide not as a possibility but as an inevitability. As the years have wasted away, I have felt myself creeping closer and closer to the edge. Last year, I realized I had very little time left. I was at a crossroads, a point of no return. Two choices presented themselves to me: I could continue as I had been and die, or I could choose to start anew as the woman I knew I truly was. For one of the very few times in my life, I chose myself. I chose life.</p>

<p>Yet here I am spiraling in this yogurt shop after having one not-actually-that-bad night. Here I am being so incredibly unkind and disrespectful to myself. Here I am pissing all over that defining choice I made last year. If this is the way I’m going to treat myself, I may as well just off myself now and save myself all the future heartache.</p>

<p>This has to stop. I literally cannot continue to live in this way. Sage will never be allowed air if I continue to abuse her like this. She’ll wither before she ever had a chance to bloom. I’m killing her slowly. Enough.</p>

<p>I don’t know what happened last night. Maybe Michelle was right and Luna got nervous when she realized things were moving along, or maybe she was never interested in me to begin with. Maybe I said something that made her uncomfortable, or maybe I annoyed her with all my questions. It doesn’t matter. Sometimes things don’t work out and it’s no one’s fault, really. That’s just life.</p>

<p><em>Life.</em> That word echoes around in my brain. One year ago, I was a walking corpse but look at me now! I’m in a yogurt shop bitching with my girlfriend about some cute girl I met. Sure, maybe things didn’t work out how I’d hoped, but this is life! This is living. I am alive right now.</p>

<p>The shopkeeper approaches our table and politely informs us the store is closing in five minutes. I take one last bite of my yogurt and look at Michelle. “Shall we go?” I ask. She nods.</p>

<p>We exit the shop and emerge onto the street. The air smells earthy, the pavement is dark and damp, but the street isn’t so gloomy anymore. I look toward the sky and glimpse the Sun peeking over some murky clouds in the distance. The rain is gone.</p>

<p>I smile to myself. I am alive right now. I am a woman and <em>I am alive right now</em>.</p>

I’ve spent the past month-and-a-half learning HTML, CSS and some other stuff to create this site—no website building tool here! It’s been a really fun learning process, and it wasn’t as difficult as I thought it would be.</p>

<p>I’m quite happy with how the site turned out. Since I have full access to the site’s code, I have full control over its styling and format, and I can do custom styling for specific pages. Pop over to the <a href="/about">about page</a>, for example.</p>

<h2 id="why-leave-substack">Why leave Substack?</h2>

<p><strong>This blog has never been interested in building an audience.</strong> If I cared to get a bunch of eyeballs on my writing, I wouldn’t write 5,000+ word posts or publish weird, sometimes experimental, obtuse poetry (that maybe isn’t even very good). Regardless, <strong>Substack is ultimately a social platform</strong>. Appended to each of my posts were like and comment counters, and every time I opened its dashboard to post my writing, I was greeted with graphs showing all sorts of social metrics. While ultimately I don’t care, seeing a graph of dwindling readership just doesn’t feel good. This new site does not have any of this. It is simply a place for my words to live, as I had originally intended this blog to be when I started it over a year ago. It will almost certainly mean significantly less readership than I had already, but I won’t know for sure. Out of sight, out of mind.</p>

<p>However, <strong>the main reason</strong> I moved my writing off Substack shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who is familiar with the happenings on that platform. <strong>Substack has a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/substacks-nazi-problem-wont-go-away-after-push-notification-apology/">history of sympathizing with Nazis</a></strong>, and that’s putting it rather charitably. Just a few months ago, a notification was pushed to many of the Substack app’s users, that directed them to a blog adorned with swastikas. A system error? I’m not eager to lend Substack the benefit of the doubt, given its past handling of similar situations.</p>

<p>I’m Autistic and trans—<em>have you heard?</em>—and live in a world that is currently frothing at the mouth to do a genocide on people like me. From RFK Jr. making up the dumbest bullshit you’ve ever heard about Autism and vaccines, to the President’s nonstop attacks against trans rights—every time I open the news I’m greeted with a fresh wave of hate aimed directly at me. We are in a genuine crisis. The last thing I want is for my writing—what represents my most personal inner thoughts and feelings—put up alongside hate-filled rhetoric advocating for the eradication of my people. Full stop.</p>

<p>I considered moving to another platform, but I didn’t find anything that I was especially happy with. And who’s to say I wouldn’t run into the same issue with another platform down the line? We see more and more bending over to fascism every single day. Instead, I decided to just make my own website where I have full control over my writing, where it appears, and how it is presented.</p>

<p><strong>Eventually, catloaf &amp; coffee will be deleted entirely from Substack.</strong> If you chose to join me on this new site, welcome! There are no comments here, but you can find my email on every page of this site in the footer, if you ever want to say hello.</p>

<p>Stay safe. It’s pretty fucked up out there.</p>

<p>That place, a vampire<br />
Only the dead persist there<br />
Linger too long and join their ranks</p>

<p>They prey on those filled of hope<br />
With spirits unbroken<br />
Till nothing is left but a lifeless husk</p>

<p>At night they prowl<br />
Looking for the brightest of sparks<br />
Innocence makes the nectar sweeter</p>

<p>Deep do their fangs penetrate<br />
Crimson oozing down their chin<br />
Just another victim of circumstance</p>

<p>Seen it happen too many times<br />
Lost many a friend to that place<br />
Promised myself I wouldn’t meet the same fate</p>

<p>Felt myself withering<br />
Knew I couldn’t stay<br />
So I turned my back on everything</p>

<p>Under false pretenses I fled<br />
Claimed the spirit of adventure<br />
To elude suspicion</p>

<p>Found sanctuary in the unlikeliest of places<br />
Here, too, monsters roam the streets<br />
Just as lethal, somehow more manageable</p>

<p>Script has been flipped<br />
I am hunter, they are hunted<br />
Still I am not at ease</p>

<p>The beating of wings echoes on the horizon<br />
In the dark they creep closer<br />
It won’t be much longer now</p>

<p>Years they scoured the earth<br />
Looking for the one who escaped their grasp<br />
Sin so unforgivable, it cannot go unpunished</p>

<p>Trained for this moment, yet<br />
Fear clutches at my heart<br />
Though I will run no longer</p>

<p>Come, ye beasts!<br />
Come, ye vampires!<br />
Come, ye creatures of the night!</p>

<p>Unfinished business we must attend<br />
Ready thy fangs<br />
Prepare to meet thy maker<br />
<br /></p>

<p>It’s funny<br />
They told you the truth<br />
Yet you kept on pretending like nothing happened</p>

<p>To be honest<br />
I don’t care about collateral anymore<br />
I’m ready to raze it all to the ground<br />
Just give me a reason</p>

<p>I’ll relish in the flames<br />
Let the fires warm my heart<br />
Watch the embers drift by<br />
Twinkling like fireflies<br />
Raise my arms high in victory<br />
And declare, <em>Liberation!</em></p>

<p>I’ve been dreaming of my demise since I turned nine<br />
Never thought I’d make it this far</p>

<p>Crawled from the deepest of depths<br />
Against all odds<br />
Bloody and broken<br />
And yet I remain</p>

<p>I wasn’t given a choice<br />
It was this or a noose<br />
I chose life</p>

<p>My existence<br />
An act of defiance<br />
A warning to any who dare stand in my way<br />
I will be denied no longer</p>

<p>Still you don’t understand what this is<br />
Still you fail to grasp the implications<br />
Still you refuse to recognize your complicity<br />
Still you shield your eyes from the pain you wrought</p>

<p>I am bitter<br />
I am angry<br />
I am hate</p>

<p>I have been denied life<br />
I have been denied a childhood<br />
I have been denied peace</p>

<p>You have denied me an identity<br />
For the sake of your ancient ideologies<br />
And absurd ideas about who I am or what I should be<br />
As if you had any fucking right</p>

<p>You, who cannot see the forest for the trees<br />
You, who is incapable of reckoning with their own behavior<br />
You, who has utterly failed to uphold the values you claim so dear<br />
You.</p>

<p>For this, you will be the recipient of my fury</p>

<p>Beware<br />
This is my calling card<br />
Deny me and be doomed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br />
Ere long you will lose that which you cannot replace</p>

<p>Soon we’ll be bathed in illustrious flame<br />
Flesh will give way to bone<br />
Bone will turn to ash<br />
And at last, I will be rid of you</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">⚠️ J.K. Rowling</div>

<p>It’s Sunday. I’m visiting some family in Tokyo. The air is sweltering but I’m taking refuge at a small, beat-up dining table in my aunt’s and uncle’s house. Five of us are huddled around the table, eating French toast under a wall-mounted air conditioner unit. It softly hums away while the kids watch YouTube on an iPad and the adults deliberate what to do with our day.</p>

<p>We float through a few ideas, but nothing really sticks. How about that Godzilla exhibit, I say. Someone says they don’t like Godzilla. We could do teamLab,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> my uncle offers. Ah, never mind, tickets are sold-out. My aunt suggests Takeshita-dori.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> No one seems interested. What about a movie, my uncle proposes. No one even dignifies that with a response.</p>

<p>My uncle’s family is in Tokyo only temporarily. I’ve been visiting them each month, trying to make good use of the time that we have together. It’s been nice seeing my cousins. We’ve always been so far apart from each other—always on different hemispheres—that we’ve barely had any opportunities to interact.</p>

<p>Most of the contact I’ve had with them was when they were born. When I was in high school, I held the oldest in my arms right after he was born, and I saw the youngest for the first time over a video call when I was a freshman in university. She was so tiny then. Now, they’re both right in front of me watching a <em>Minecraft</em> “Let’s Play,” faces sticky from maple syrup. Babies no more. I feel old.</p>

<p>I have lots of these kinds of moments nowadays: Something reminds me of something else that in my mind is just a year-or-two old and then I realize it’s actually more like a full decade old except I can clearly remember when it was new and then I feel ancient and then I start to panic about my mortality and how I’ll be hitting 30 in just a couple of years and how I absolutely cannot be 30 and still a boy which shouldn’t actually be a problem because I’m transitioning but like, what if my transition is a failure?</p>

<p>I’m spiraling. I tell myself to calm down; that it’s a ridiculous thing to be having an existential crisis over some French toast at a comically small dining table at 10:30 in the morning. Deep breaths. Okay. I’m okay. I return to the present. We’ve still not settled on a plan for the day. I should probably think of some more ideas, else we might actually be here all day at this damn table. I love my uncle’s family, but settling on plans doesn’t seem to be their strong suit.</p>

<p>I know lots of places in Tokyo but I don’t normally have to consider children. Hmm. What do kids like? (God, I’m so old.) Well, my students love Harry Potter, and there’s that studio tour somewhere in Tokyo that we could go—the one with all the recreated sets from the movies that you can walk around on.</p>

<p>I ask if the kids like Harry Potter. They love Harry Potter, my uncle says. I tell him about the studio tour. He asks the kids if they want to go. The oldest says it sounds cool. The youngest asks what is Harry Potter?</p>

<p>They’ll love it, my uncle says, let’s do that.</p>

<p>We purchase tickets online, but our entry time is still a few hours away—a commonly used crowd-control tactic in Japan. We decide to bide our time by heading into Shinjuku for lunch and seeing the Godzilla statue there, because the kids haven’t seen it before.</p>

<p>Wait, didn’t someone say they don’t like Godzilla? I guess they changed their mind? I can’t keep up.</p>

<p>We take the train into Shinjuku. It is dirty and smells like shit, which is unusual for Tokyo but not for Shinjuku which is lined with bars as far as the eye can see. It’s not uncommon to stumble upon a puddle of vomit in the street here. It’s a lovely place.</p>

<p>While I guide everyone to the monster’s lair, the kids complain about the heat. It <em>is</em> hot. My clothes are starting to stick to my skin. I’m holding my pastel-pink umbrella aloft to provide some shade, but I can feel the band of my sports bra getting wetter by the second as beads of sweat run down my back. We haven’t even been outside for ten minutes. I love this country, but damn, is the summer intolerable.</p>

<p>Soon, we reach the famed Toho movie theatre with the great <em>kaiju</em> peaking over its top. A massive claw rests atop the theatre’s roof and a familiar round noggin floats above it. Its jaws are fixed open, frozen in a menacing grin. With its red eyes, it glares at the people meandering in the street below, going about their lives as if there isn’t a giant 20-story tall monster about to annihilate them all.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jieyeu">Jie Yeu Teoh</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-city-street-filled-with-lots-of-tall-buildings-lOmsiNYE_o0">Unsplash</a></div>
<p>I happen to visit this theatre semi-regularly, so I’ve seen this sight a few dozen times before but I must admit, it <em>is</em> pretty cool. The kids think so, too, but only for about twenty seconds, after which we’re all standing on the street corner like, yep. That’s Godzilla.</p>

<p>It’s noon, so we head underground in pursuit of someplace to eat lunch. We settle on a restaurant that serves various standard Japanese-fare—<em>okonomiyaki</em>, <em>yakisoba</em>, and so on—and wait in line. Japan loves to queue. When people think of the Japanese Experience, they think of <em>geisha</em> and <em>kimono</em> and temples and <em>sakura</em>. But in reality, it often looks like staring at the back of a stranger’s head for hours on end—not exactly the exotic paradise everyone hopes for.</p>

<p>Waiting in line means we’re idle, and anyone who’s ever been around children knows that being idle is a very bad thing, indeed. Idle kids get bored, and bored kids aren’t something that anyone really wants, so my aunt takes the youngest to go look at some other restaurants in an attempt to bide our time, but this is an obvious rookie mistake. Article 237-C of the Hammurabi Code clearly states that one should never deviate from a plan once it is agreed upon by all children present. (Probably.)</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s too late. The restaurant we’re queueing at is deemed no longer acceptable.</p>

<p>The new plan is a curry and <em>onigiri</em> joint around the corner. We surrender our place in line and march over to this new place, and a problem immediately presents itself: it’s <em>tiny</em>. There’s no way the five of us could fit in there. So what now? Do we go back to the restaurant we just left? No, that’s stupid. And we’ve wasted so much time in our failed pursuit of food, that there isn’t much time left before we need to head to the studio tour.</p>

<p>Let’s just grab some onigiri and head over, my uncle says. We just ate breakfast, anyway.</p>

<p><em>Well</em>, this girlie is going through puberty again, and she could eat a whole-ass bear or two despite the French toast from a couple of hours ago. But she’s also a <em>lady</em>, so she’ll keep quiet about this to preserve the integrity of our expedition.</p>

<p>I sigh, but not loud enough for anyone to hear. I must express my dissatisfaction, but not in a confrontational way because I know I’m being a little unreasonable—just enough to make myself feel a little better about my lack of agency.</p>

<p>My uncle guides us through Shinjuku’s underbelly for like, 20 minutes to find an onigiri stand, which is odd considering onigiri is a dime-a-dozen in this country and we passed approximately 83 onigiri stands on the way to this one. This particular stand has a specialty for spicy tuna onigiri, which the kids seem excited about, at least. I reluctantly choose an onigiri made of fried rice, making sure to take a half-second longer to order so as to express my displeasure at this whole turn of events. We wolf down our snacks, then head over to the tour’s venue.</p>

<p>The site of “Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo”—a name so obviously terrible it comes paired with a more descriptive subtitle, “The Making of Harry Potter,” which makes for an absurdly long title in full—is rather unassuming. A well-manicured lawn dotted with minimalist sculptures resembling various iconography from the Harry Potter films stretches out in front of a rather boring, boxy building. The only dead giveaway that we’re in the right place is the large Harry Potter logo above the entrance.</p>

<p>Yes, I kind of fucked up. We’re in Tokyo, one of the largest cities in the world, a place that <em>really does have it all</em>—and I bring everyone to the Harry Potter studio tour, of all places. We’re here because of <em>me</em>. <em>I</em> did this. Why is a trans girl suggesting we go somewhere built in honor of an IP that’s the product of <em>the</em> reigning TERF bitch? Look, estrogen makes you pretty, not smart. I wanted to see the kids happy and I panicked, okay? We couldn’t decide on anything, it’s our last weekend together before everyone leaves, and I just wanted to have a good time. I know I fucked up. I know.</p>

<p>And I’m regretting it already. Seeing that massive logo looming above me makes me feel strange, a bit uncomfortable. As we wait in line—because this is Japan, remember, we love to queue here—I look around me and everyone seems pretty damn straight and very cisgender. Meanwhile, here I am in a full face of makeup, a pink T-shirt with a cute cartoon bear on it, and breezy bottoms that no cisgender man would ever wear.</p>

<p>The Harry Potter logo looks upon me with disgust. <em>Tranny,</em> it jeers.</p>

<p>Shut up, Harry Potter logo. You’re just a sign.</p>

<p>While our tickets are scanned one-by-one, I anxiously consider what the insides of this building might contain. I hope it’ll be like the <em>Harry Potter 20th Anniversary</em> reunion, where everyone talked <em>around</em> J. K. Rowling, and anytime she did pop onscreen it was paired with a disclaimer that the segment was filmed years ago, as if the filmmakers were profusely apologizing for having to include her at all.</p>

<p>Yeah, I hope it’s like that.</p>

<p>It’s not like that. As soon as we enter the building, we’re greeted with a quote from one of the books, prominently displayed on a large banner and proudly attributed to the queen bitch herself. Oh god, what I have done.</p>

<p>We enter the main lobby: a cavernous carpeted space littered with benches and large LED displays running the length of its walls. To our left is a gift shop styled in the Ministry of Magic’s iconic green-and-black tile, to our right is a food court themed like Hogwarts’ Great Hall, and immediately ahead is a shadowy hole in the wall. Next to it sits a sign that reads, STUDIO TOUR ENTRANCE. We head straight there. I look longingly in the food court’s direction the whole way.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/studioTourMap.jpg" alt="map of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo" /></p>
<div class="caption">A map of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo. It fails to convey how truly massive a space it is. (Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.)</div>

<p>Beyond the ominous entrance lie massive on-set photos from each Harry Potter film, presented with a 3D-layered effect. My youngest cousin asks why there are cameras visible in some of the pictures, as if the tour creators made a glaring oversight. It’s a <em>studio</em> tour, I explain, we get to see how the movies were made! Oh, she says.</p>

<p>She’s adorable.</p>

<p>We’re corralled by staff into a dark rectangular room plastered with movie posters all along the front wall. My aunt points out one of the posters with Johnny Depp, and I say I don’t remember him in any of the films. He was in one of the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> movies, she says. Oh, I say, I never saw those. She puffs out her bottom lip. That’s a shame, she says. They’re fun!</p>

<p>On the back wall is a row of portraits of all the films’ directors. At the end of the lineup is a familiar face: J. K. Rowling, with that stupid smirk that she always makes in photos. Can’t she just smile like a normal person? It isn’t that hard, girl.</p>

<p>I consider taking a picture of myself flipping off her portrait, but quickly abandon the idea as a large mass of people pushes into the space. The doors ahead are closed and we’re all standing around looking at these movie posters we’ve all seen a million times before. A staff member monologues about each of the posters. It’s very boring and very long. I’m not paying much attention because it’s all being conducted in Japanese and I don’t feel like applying my brain right now, and also I can’t shake the feeling of the hole being bored into my head from J. K. Rowling’s smug mug behind me.</p>

<p>Finally, the doors ahead are opened. Can we actually start the tour now? Nope. Instead, we’re being corralled into another dark and rectangular space. This room has a long LED screen spanning the width of the far wall, that shows Harry’s Japanese voice actor explaining the tour’s rules and teasing all the things we’re about to see.</p>

<p>Like, yeah dude, just let us see for ourselves. You don’t have to sell us on this. We’ve bought tickets already. Let us in!</p>

<p>The presentation ends with clips of fans dressed in wizard robes talking about what Harry Potter means to them. It feels like some weird corporate diversity video meant to show that <em>Harry Potter is for everyone</em>! I look around me. The room is very crowded—there’s probably a couple hundred people in here—but there’s not a single queer-presenting person in the room, save for me. I want to melt into a puddle and seep into the floor.</p>

<p>The doors ahead are opened and at last we can start- oh for fuck’s sake, Warner Brothers! Another dark rectangular room? I’m beginning to think this tour is just one big practical joke.</p>

<p>This room is much larger. It’s a cinema, complete with a large projection screen and several rows of theatre seats. We seat ourselves in the front row and Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson (<em>queen</em>) appear onscreen to give an introduction to the tour. If my math is correct, this is now the third introduction to the tour (that everyone has already paid real money to attend) that we’re being subjected to. We “started” the tour 30 minutes ago. The kids are growing a little impatient. I am too.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this introduction is shorter than the others. The theatre screen is raised into the ceiling, and <em>behold!</em> The entrance doors to Hogwarts. It’s pretty cool, I must admit. We all crowd around the doors, and a staff member asks the crowd if anyone is celebrating a birthday or an anniversary. No one responds. He asks again. No one responds. He asks again. No one responds. He nervously chuckles to himself.</p>

<p>Refusing to be deterred, he asks for like, the fifth time. A child raises his hand and pushes through the crowd. The kid is maybe 12 years old. The staff member asks, <em>completely sincerely</em>, if today is his birthday or anniversary. I burst out laughing. No one else in the crowd offers even a hint of a laugh.</p>

<p>Kill me, kill me, kill me.</p>

<p>The kid is instructed to push open the doors at the count of three, but he doesn’t seem to understand much Japanese, and this staff member doesn’t know how to handle this. (I mean, who could possibly have foreseen that the big Harry Potter attraction would bring in overseas guests?) Eventually, they figure it out and the tour is allowed to begin at last. We shuffle through the double doors and into a recreation of Hogwarts’ Great Hall.</p>

<p>True to its name, it is pretty great. The floor is made of (fake) large stone slabs and the ceiling is simply bare lighting, just like the actual film set because the hall’s ceiling was added in post. The walls are lined with the hall’s iconic dining tables, and at each house’s section are mannequins donning their respective robes. At the far end of the hall, where the school’s staff would sit, is the Goblet of Fire. Two mannequins resembling Fred and George Weasley with long white beards are sprawled out on the floor in front of the artifact, recreating the scene from the fourth film.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/greatHall.jpg" alt="Hogwarts' Great Hall" /></p>
<div class="caption">Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</div>

<p>A staff member approaches the goblet, introduces it, and then a burst of blue fire erupts from the goblet’s mouth. A little slip of paper shoots out from inside it and the staff member catches it in midair, gasps, and shows the paper to the crowd. It reads HARRY POTTER. Everyone claps. It’s very <em>sugoi</em>.</p>

<p>The kids are loving it. They’re excitedly bouncing around the hall, ooh-ing and ahh-ing at every little thing. There’s nothing quite like being a kid.</p>

<p>What’s that, the youngest asks. She points at some mannequins in green-and-black robes. That’s the Slytherin house, my uncle replies. They look bad, she says. Yeah, I say, they’re pretty bad. She bounces away to look at something else.</p>

<p>Once we’ve had our fill of the Great Hall, we move into the following rooms. We’re greeted with a behind-the-scenes look at the hall’s construction and then a room highlighting the iconic moving marble staircase. It’s been rebuilt here and it actually moves!</p>

<p>Next, is a large space showcasing the sets of the living areas at Hogwarts. There’s the Gryffindor and Slytherin common rooms, dorms, and Dumbledore’s office. Everything is just as I remember it from the films. Oh, there’s the fireplace where Harry spoke to Sirius in <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>! There’s where Ron and Harry argued about girls in <em>Goblet of Fire</em>. That’s the sword Harry uses in <em>Chamber of Secrets</em>.</p>

<p>Across from the Slytherin common room is an area where you can become spectators in a Quidditch match. The five of us are grouped up with about 15 others and are led onto a small set resembling the spectator stands from the films. We’re coached through various reactions while being filmed, then we’re guided to a display that shows a Quidditch scene from <em>Philosopher’s Stone</em> with our reactions cut in. It’s horribly cheesy, but the kids are going crazy for it.</p>

<p>I can’t stop looking at myself, though. Jesus Christ, I look like that? The camera caught me from a 45-degree angle and my side profile is dreadful. It’s so angular. It screams “man.” Gross. I feel sick.</p>

<p>Trying to hide my disgust, I cower in the back while everyone else laughs at the ridiculous edit on the display. After what feels like an eternity, the video ends and I shove past everyone, then hide in the Room of Requirement. Bad move. Everything here is reflective, and now I’m staring at my distorted face in various pots and pans. Ugly, ugly, ugly, they chant.</p>

<p>It would be brilliant if I could stop thinking about being trans for just a single minute. Every waking second of my existence is consumed with obsessive thoughts about how I look, how I sound, how I stand, how I walk, how I act. I look at everyone around me and compare myself to them, which is a very stupid thing to do, but as I previously established, this girlie isn’t the brightest.</p>

<p>And like, everyone in Tokyo is <em>so hot</em>. Both the women and the men. Everyone has these perfectly crafted outfits, glowing skin, and gorgeous hair. I want to be friends with all of them and learn their secrets. I want to date all of them and kiss them. I want to <em>be</em> them.</p>

<p>Then there’s me standing in front of an old chrome pot, staring at my warped face. I look like a blobfish.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/mrBlobby.jpg" alt="blobfish" title="it me" /></p>
<div class="caption">An actual picture of what I look like. Weren’t expecting a face reveal, I bet. (Kerryn Parkinson, <i>NORFANZ Expedition</i>)</div>

<p>The next part of the tour focuses on the learning environments at Hogwarts: Defense Against the Dark Arts and Potions classrooms, and the library. Wedged in between the classroom sets is the Mirror of Erised, in which Harry sees his parents in <em>Philosopher’s Stone</em>. At the studio tour, it’s been turned into a selfie opportunity. An orderly queue (I really wasn’t lying about Japan loving to queue) rests off to the side, with a long line of visitors patiently waiting for their turn. My aunt and uncle want a photo with everyone, so we take a place at the end of the line.</p>

<p>I am not thrilled about this, but what am I going to do? I’ve been running into this issue for my entire life: I’ve always <em>hated</em> taking photos, for reasons that should be obvious, but if I object to taking a photo everyone acts as if I personally insulted their mothers. I’ve learned to shut up and just go along with it. It’s easier that way.</p>

<p>As we wait for our turn, I try my best to dissociate. It works. Now I’m numb and I don’t really care about having to look at my reflection again. I watch my body from some high vantage point as we stand in front of the mirror. We smile, my uncle takes a couple of pictures, and then we give up our spot to the next group in line. My uncle shows us the photos. Everyone is smiling perfectly, looking so happy.</p>

<p>Isn’t it strange that we always smile in photos, even if we aren’t actually happy in the moment? We willingly choose to alter our memories of events, warping them with false records because god forbid we remember things as they actually happened. Our camera rolls depict much happier images of our lives than what actually occurred. It’s never made sense to me. The false smiles of mine that permeate the majority of the photos ever taken of me only remind me of just how unhappy or uncomfortable I actually was at the time. I can look at photos and recall the bullshit behind each smile: In this one, I said I didn’t want to be in the picture, and then there was a big argument about it right before we took the picture. Oh, in this one, I look super happy but really I was thinking about going home and hanging myself. Good times!</p>

<p>We proceed into the Forbidden Forest. Thick, towering trees surround us. The ground is a soft, squishy rubber made to look like dirt. In here, there are no reflective surfaces and everything is cast into shadow, so I’m able to slowly regain my composure. I watch the kids run about the forest, giggling with excitement. Screens are hung on the walls in between the trees to create the illusion of dementors flying through the woods. You can stand in front of these screens and mime a patronus charm to ward off the creatures. It’s a big hit with the kids.</p>

<p>After braving an encounter with the forest’s eight-legged inhabitants, we’re spit outside in front of Hagrid’s hut and a café behind it. A staff member informs us we’re at the halfway-point of the tour. Damn. We’ve spent nearly three hours here already.</p>

<p>We decide to eat lunch. For real this time. The café serves a host of themed foods, mostly consisting of British cuisine. I order the Slytherin plate: bangers and mash and an oolong tea. It’s <em>fine</em>. Definitely overpriced, but this is to be expected at a venue like this.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/cafeMenu.png" alt="Backlot Cafe menu" /></p>
<div class="caption">¥2,900 for mashed potatoes, peas, and a curly sausage? It’s a bit expensive by Tokyo standards. (Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.)</div>

<p>Before we commence the second half of the tour, I stop by the restroom. I hang a right to the men’s restroom because I’m not looking to start an <em>incident</em>, and lock myself in a stall. I hang my bag on the door’s hook and feel around inside for my mirror and lipstick, carefully reapply it, then brush my hair. This is a bit silly, really. There’s a huge mirror right outside, but instead I’m choosing to hide in a smelly stall to do my touch-ups. I’m still going to be walking around in the men’s restroom in a full face of makeup and feminine attire, but I guess it’s a step too far to openly reapply my lipstick.</p>

<p>Anxiety is stupid.</p>

<p>We resume our tour and arrive at Platform 9 ¾. The noble Hogwarts Express sits proudly at the station, steam billowing from its smokestack, impressing with its tremendous size. I stand in the middle of the platform, full of visitors going to-and-fro just like a real train platform, and it hits me:</p>

<p>Little Sage is <em>loving</em> this. She’s fan-girling <em>so hard</em> right now. This whole tour is basically all she ever wanted. Harry Potter was <em>everything</em> to me. I adored the books, and when I saw the movies it was like a religious experience. To now be walking around in the very spaces I read about is a dream come true.</p>

<p>Because they weren’t just books. They were a window to another world, another reality. A place where even the mundane was wondrous. A place where anything could—and did—happen. The Wizarding World was everything the real world wasn’t: Thrilling. Exciting. Happy. I wanted so badly to live there, and for most of my elementary school years I basically did.</p>

<p>I never had many friends. I still don’t. As it turns out, being Autistic and actually a girl (even though no one sees it, really) doesn’t make for a wealth of popularity. But at Hogwarts, I had Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I was right there with them—running all over the school grounds, getting into wacky hijinks, fighting Death Eaters, and drinking Butterbeer. They weren’t characters. They were <em>my friends</em>, and they accepted me even when no one else would.</p>

<p>But now, it’s all wrong. Here I am on Platform 9 ¾ and I should be over the moon, yet I feel so conflicted. Everywhere on this tour are various quotes from the books, all attributed to J. K. Rowling. Her dumb face pops up in various spots like a jump scare in some throwaway horror flick. She’s inescapable. This world that had played such a pivotal role in my formative years now feels nauseating. Normally, I’m a big proponent of separating the art from the artist, but Harry Potter has been steeped in its creator’s hate-fueled campaign for far too long to ignore. It’s wrong. We shouldn’t have come here. I shouldn’t have come here.</p>

<p>But still the tour continues. Now we’re walking on the green-and-black tiles of the Ministry of Magic. I stand in front of Dolores Umbridge’s pink dress, and it feels strangely fitting because by this point in the story the curtain has been lifted. After a brief stint as headmaster of Hogwarts, Umbridge is now in the belly of the authoritative Ministry of Magic and is no longer hiding her true nefarious nature; just as Rowling isn’t hiding her hatred for people like me. I think of her stupid cigar photo. She may as well be the one in this dress.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/jkrowlingCigar-Censored.jpg" alt="JK Rowling smoking cigar with devil horns and eyes crossed out" title="bitch." /></p>
<div class="caption">Following the UK’s Supreme Court ruling that the term “woman” does not apply to trans women, Rowling posted this image (edits mine) with the caption: “I love it when a plan comes together.” Cunt. (<a href="https://x.com/jk\_rowling/status/1912644919103004807">J.K. Rowling on X</a>)</div>

<p>I don’t know whether I want to scream, cry, or both, but I decide that the cold interior of the Ministry isn’t the place for either of those things. We meander through a section showing how the books’ magical creatures were realized on screen, and then we hop in line for the Broomstick Experience. First, a staff member takes a group photo (ugh) and then whisks us away to a green stall with a broomstick suspended horizontally. My oldest cousin mounts it and is instructed to give various reactions and poses, while he’s superimposed into a scene from <em>Goblet of Fire</em> where Harry flys away from a dragon, except instead of Harry it’s now my cousin. Everyone laughs. The youngest especially.</p>

<p>It’s my uncle’s turn. He makes crazy, exaggerated movements and the kids are bowled over with laughter. He’s a good dad. I’m laughing, too, but only because I’m trying to blend in. Really, I’m dreading being asked to get on the broomstick because I don’t think I can handle seeing myself on camera again.</p>

<p>The staff member motions for me to enter the stall. I politely decline. Everyone seems a little bummed.</p>

<p>I am, too. I feel like a disappointment. I wish I wasn’t like this.</p>

<p>We’re almost finished now. Just two main features to go. After the Broomstick Experience is an exhibit explaining foley-work, and then <em>there it is</em>: Diagon Alley.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/diagonAlley.jpg" alt="Diagon Alley" /></p>
<div class="caption">Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</div>

<p>Of all the books’ many locales, this is certainly the most whimsical, which is probably why this set was saved for last. Its winding path stretches out in front of us, utilizing a bit of forced perspective that makes it all seem at least twice as big as it really is. Just like in the films, shops are jammed haphazardly together, painted in all sorts of vibrant colors, and constructed in impossible geometry. I waltz over to 93 Diagon Alley, where Weasley &amp; Weasley is located. Inside are endless shelves of multicolored boxes paired with zany signs detailing their contents. In the middle of the shop floor is a statue of a child holding a large bowl containing purple-and-green candies. The statue has a concerningly round head and is hunched over the bowl, mouth unnaturally agape, as a steady flow of the candies expel from its orifice into the bowl. Beside the statue is a sign that reads PUKING PASTILLES. I feel a strange sense of kinship with the thing.</p>

<p>The set is immaculately kept and exhaustively detailed, but I’m quite tired of this place. I’m ready to leave, and not just because I feel <em>weird</em> about being trans at Hogwarts. We’ve been here for over five hours now. As impressively comprehensive a tour as this is, it is <em>so very long</em>.</p>

<p>Luckily, there’s only one stop left in our tour. We pass through a hallway featuring a spread of the Marauder’s Map to the tour’s final chamber. It is a vast, black chamber housing a staggeringly massive model of the Hogwarts grounds in full. It’s difficult to convey the size of it. The room is essentially two or three stories tall. We enter at the top and <em>still</em> the model towers before us. It’s a brilliant finale, even if it does feel hollow.</p>

<p>At long last, our tour has come to a close. We’re spit out into the gift shop, which is inexplicably larger than the Great Hall and Diagon Alley sets combined. I peruse the merchandise while the kids sort through plushies. There are wands, robes, hats, building sets, pins, stationary, confectionaries, Butterbeer, figures—far too much to list off, even if I could remember all of the shop’s offerings. I cannot deny that this stuff is cool. It’s not junk. It’s quality stuff. I would totally buy an irresponsible amount of merch, if it weren’t for J. K. Rowling’s stench plaguing everything in sight.</p>

<p>It’s past six now. We decide we may as well grab dinner before we leave, so we walk to the dining hall styled like Hogwarts’ Great Hall. I order an English breakfast, which like the bangers and mash, is aggressively overpriced. The toast is branded with “9 ¾” in a meager attempt to tie the meal into the theming. It tastes like styrofoam. It’s a bit sad.</p>

<p>I finish my meal before everyone else because I ordered first. In Japan, meals are brought out whenever they’re ready so usually you eat when your food arrives, even if other members in your party are still waiting to receive their order. I watch the kids eat. Somehow, they appear to be getting just as much food in their mouths as on their faces.</p>

<p>Our kids have the worst table manners, my uncle says. I chuckle. It’s gross but also cute, in a little kid sort of way.</p>

<p>Eventually, watching the messy display in front of me grows old, so I look around the room. We’re sat close to where the dining hall meets the main lobby. I look toward the exit. Above it is a quote immortalized in golden letters that reads, WHETHER YOU COME BACK BY PAGE OR BY THE BIG SCREEN, HOGWARTS WILL ALWAYS BE THERE TO WELCOME YOU HOME. In small letters below, the quote’s author is revealed: J. K. Rowling.</p>

<p>Those words were originally spoken nearly 15 years ago, during the premiere of the <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 2</em>. It was a simpler time when the Wizarding World yet lacked the political undertones it carries today. Rowling’s hatred of the trans community wouldn’t come to light until many years later. But in 2025, the quote suspended above takes on a more nuanced meaning: Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you, except for me because I am trans.</p>

<p>I get up from the table and capture the only photo I take of the entire tour. I lazily position the quote in frame and then my right hand with its middle finger extended. Like our group photo at the Mirror of Erised, it paints a false image of the current moment. It implies anger and defiance, but I feel neither of these things. I’m just sad, and tired. Tired of being sad.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/jkrowlingFuckYou.jpg" alt="my middle finger extended to J.K. Rowling's quote" title="bullshit!" /></p>

<p>I look back to my cousins in the dining hall, still painting their faces with their dinner. They’re so innocent, so beautifully oblivious to the sinister bigotry lurking behind everything around us. They are free to run about and take everything at face-value. They don’t have to hyper-analyze everything for its subtext, or consider whether they should even be here at all. Hogwarts is just a magical school from some old movies. Dobby is just a funny little guy. J. K. Rowling is just a face on a wall. I envy them.</p>

<p>For many trans people—and Autistics, of which I am one—childhood is a blur. I don’t remember my childhood much. I remember only a few things: a constant state of unease, the resulting persistent desire to no longer exist, weirdness from growing up in the church. It’s difficult to recall anything especially positive, but Harry Potter has always been one of the few exceptions. Now, I don’t even have that.</p>

<p>We exit the tour building. The front lawn is now illuminated by moonlight. As we walk to the nearby train station, my aunt asks if I’ll finally watch the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> movies.</p>

<p>No, I say, I don’t think I will.</p>

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">👀 Vague spoilers for <i>I Saw the TV Glow</i>.</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">ℹ️ Originally posted on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/neko_and_co/film/i-saw-the-tv-glow/5/">Letterboxd</a>, with a bit of added polishing for <b>catloaf &amp; coffee</b>.</div>

<p>Once one pushes past the initial fear, starting transition is exciting. It’s time to start hormones, buy new clothes, try a new hairstyle, learn makeup, and get a piercing or two. Eventually, though, some time passes and one has checked all those little boxes, and now there’s not much left to do but wait.</p>

<p>Five months into my transition, I’m feeling the lull set in. Of course, I can still work on my wardrobe and makeup skills and so on. But the initial rush of euphoria that comes along with all those “firsts” has come and gone. Now I’m left to slowly watch myself change in the mirror. It’s tough. I didn’t realize how heavily I’d been relying on the highs of that initial transition period, so as I move into this next phase of my transition, I’ve found myself feeling especially dysphoric. Many a day has gone by where I’m at the verge of tears at every hour of the day.</p>

<p>Frustrated and wanting to <em>do something</em> to further my progress, I was playing around with FaceApp’s feminization filter, hoping it would provide pointers on what I should focus on. (Yes, consulting an AI-powered filters app for tips on my transition is almost certainly a bad idea, but I was feeling desperate.) After feeding it a few pictures of myself from the past year, I came to a curious realization: in recent pictures, the filter barely touched my face at all and just gave me longer hair. But in pictures from the start of my transition, the filter changed my whole face. This made me feel a bit better about my progress. It helped me to see the genuinely substantial changes I’ve undergone in a mere five months. Of course, I’m still not anywhere near where I want to be—hell, the app itself assumes my gender as male—but it was nice to be able to recognize the progress I’ve made.</p>

<p>Even so, the filter’s recommendation was to grow my hair out longer. Fair enough. I’d already been considering doing so, however this meant more waiting around for things to happen… not exactly the brilliant action-packed plan I was hoping for.</p>

<p>I was feeling lost. I felt myself beginning to slip as doubt crept in. <em>You’ll never be a girl. You’ll always just be a dude in makeup.</em></p>

<p>I needed guidance, and there was only one place I could think of to go: <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>.</p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-beans.png" /></div>

<p>I pushed play. <em>Let’s go to church.</em></p>

<p>Two minutes into the runtime, a gym class parachute lined with white, blue, pink, and purple stripes billows through the air as <em>Anthems For A Seventeen Year-Old Girl</em> by yeule hums in the background. I can feel it hitting already. My face is scrunched up, I’m sniffling, tears running down my cheek. It’s an ugly sight, I’m sure, but no one is around. It’s just me, my cat plushie, and <em>TV Glow</em>.</p>

<p>Soon, Caroline Polachek sings of girls with makeup in <em>Starburned and Unkissed</em> as Owen strolls through his high school’s hallways. I’m losing it. In my first viewing, I cried here, too—albeit with far fewer tears, as I was emotionally stunted then. But tonight, with testosterone eradicated, my lips are wet and taste of salt. Tonight, <em>I am</em> one of the girls in makeup.</p>

<p>Ere long, it’s time for Maddy’s monologue, and I swear this is the greatest monologue ever committed to film and <em>I will fight anyone who says otherwise</em>. Maddy literally looks into the camera and says they pissed and shit their pants and it somehow works. I don’t understand <em>how</em> it works, only that it does. <em>Bravo</em>, Jack Haven.</p>

<p>(<em>For the steaming pile of dog shit that is</em> Emilia Pérez <em>to have been nominated for Best Picture and not this is perhaps one of the greatest travesties of our times. Then again, maybe no one should care about an award show that only started <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5372650/oscar-voting-changes">requiring its judges to actually watch the films</a> they vote on after 97 whole-ass years. I digress.</em>)</p>

<p>(<em>Actually, one more thing. Did you know <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/zoe-saldana-emilia-perez-oscar-trans-1235131572/">Zoe Saldaña’s Oscar statue is trans</a>? It goes by they/them. Yes, the statue. Thank you, Zoe Saldaña, very cool. Next time you want to give a nod to the marginalized community that the film you won an award for centers around, try doing so in your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeCv6NyMveg">acceptance speech</a>. You know, the place where you’ll have the most eyeballs? I. Digress.</em>)</p>

<p>As Maddy delivers their speech in the planetarium, I feel something welling up inside of me. So many emotions. Fear? Hopelessness? Denial? No. Once, these were the things I felt in response to this film, but no longer. Tonight, I feel happy. Hopeful. Grateful for having seen this film and absorbed its teachings. Joyful for having finally discovered myself; for starting season six.</p>

<p>The tears are rushing down my face now. My nose is oozing down my upper lip, and I taste a rather off-putting concoction of salty tears and bitter mucus. My eyes feel swollen. I’m going through it, girl.</p>

<p>I start shaking. I can’t control it. I’m squeezing this plushie within an inch of its nonexistent life and I’m wildly shaking. In this moment, I feel Maddy’s every word. Every breath. Every step. This feeling is so intense I feel like I might burst. It’s overwhelming. I can barely handle it.</p>

<p>The monologue ends. My heart feels like it’s about to burst out of my chest but I slowly calm down.</p>

<p>Now Owen is screaming in the Fun Center’s party room. Last year, this scene shook me to my core. Tonight, I watch in sadness for Owen, but feel at ease knowing that I’ve spared myself this fate.</p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-beans.png" /></div>

<p>Words cannot begin to express how much this film means to me. I know because I’ve been trying to put its impact on me into words ever since I first saw this film back in October. I wrote an <a href="/2025/i-saw-the-tv-glow-and-it-terrified-me/">8,000 word personal essay</a> using <em>TV Glow</em> as a framework for my own coming out story, and much to my chagrin it completely fails at communicating the transcendent power this film holds for me. The English language simply doesn’t possess the verbiage—and I, the writing prowess—to convey these emotions.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, here I am trying to convey them yet again. Despite having seen <em>TV Glow</em> six times now and having poured over its script countless times when writing that aforementioned essay, this most recent viewing drew out an emotional response in me greater than ever before. Its magic isn’t fading. Not even a little.</p>

<p>I’m just… <em>so fucking happy</em> to be where I am now. I’m learning to love myself, and I owe it all to this film—to Jane Schoenbrun, to Jack Haven, to Justice Smith; everyone who made this work of art possible. This film birthed me a new life.</p>

<p><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> and trembled before God while she smiled back at me. Nothing was the same since.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">⚠️ Does this need a content warning? I don’t know.

And like, obviously this post isn’t safe for work, but if you clicked on a post titled “Sad Bitch Hour” thinking it’d be safe for work, who’s the clown here? It ain’t me, sister.</div>

<p>Sorry, what’s that?</p>

<p>How’s the transition going, you ask?</p>

<p>Oh girl, you want to know?</p>

<p>Are you sure?</p>

<p>You <em>really</em> want to know?</p>

<p>You <em>really, really</em> want to know?</p>

<p>Alright, I’ll tell you.</p>

<p>But just remember, <em>you asked for this</em>…</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to my waking nightmare.</strong></p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-beans.png" /></div>

<p>Ugh. Fuck, why? Why??</p>

<p>To my great displeasure, I have awoken in yet another day. Today it is Sunday, which means it’s the second part of this <em>wondrous</em> weekend I’m having. Yesterday was shit but maybe today will be better?</p>

<p>Of course it fucking won’t. It’s 2025, girl! We’re all rapidly plummeting toward the-world-as-we-know-it’s death and the brakes failed ages ago. It only gets worse from here. Welcome to the new normal. Put on your big girl panties.</p>

<p>(Or don’t actually, because you still have your male appendage so you sure as hell aren’t gonna fit in them.)</p>

<p>I pull out my phone and start my morning scroll. Yeah, yeah, doomscrolling is bad for you, but don’t worry I know what I’m doing because I heard about something called <em>exposure therapy</em> once.</p>

<p>I’m on reddit because I guess I hate myself, or maybe I have an unexplored masochism kink. Both are equally likely. My feed is comprised of cat photos, some whining about the <em>absolute state</em> of various video games, and a whole lot of trans-related posts. Posts like:</p>

<p><em>Someone called me Ms. at work and I really liked it, am I trans?</em></p>

<p><em>I want to cry every time I look in the mirror, what’s wrong with me?</em></p>

<p><em>I’m dating this girl who thought she was a lesbian until she met me and she says I’m not like other guys, what does this mean?</em></p>

<p><em>My boyfriend said I’ll never be a woman and called me a tranny, is he being transphobic?</em></p>

<p>God, this shit is like, <em>so 2024</em>. Bitch, you’re trans. The answer is always that you’re trans and you should break up with your boyfriend. Or something. Whatever. I don’t care.</p>

<p>Today, I do not care. Today, I regret waking up.</p>

<p>I think I’m at a low point in my transition, honestly. I’ve ticked off a lot of the easy boxes like buying new clothes, learning makeup, and getting my ears pierced. Now I’m left with the hard, not-so-fun, long-term stuff like laser hair removal (maybe one day I won’t be a broke bitch and can afford it) and voice training and growing my hair out and just fucking waiting around for hormones to do their thing. I can actually see the girl in the mirror now—whoop-de-fucking-doo—but it’s basically just a waiting game until I actually reach her.</p>

<p>And goddamn, haven’t I waited long enough? Get off your ass, girl! Why are you making me chase you? Meet me halfway, at least. Fuck.</p>

<p>I wallow in my misery underneath my weighted blanket for a while. I need to go into the city today to buy a business casual outfit—or “cool biz” as it’s known in Japan—for a conference on Tuesday. The only clothes I have that fit the bill are from pre-transition when I was bloated to all hell, and honey we can’t be having any of that now, can we?</p>

<p>Thinking about going out into public like <em>this</em> makes me want to die, though. So I present an incredible offer to my rational brain (RB): what about today’s shopping, <em>tomorrow</em>? That’s good. God, I’m so innovative. Steve Jobs should hire me.</p>

<p>Alright, it’s a stupid fucking idea, but it’s exactly the kind of stupid fucking idea that I’m currently prone to going along with, and sure enough RB falls for it. Ha, dumbass! Not even estrogen can vanquish the procrastinator within me.</p>

<p>I should probably actually do something with my day, though. I may be a sad bitch, but I at least have enough sense to realize that wallowing around in bed all day isn’t actually as intelligent of a plan as I might think. Get up, RB commands. Ugh. Just a few more minutes. Get the fuck up, RB screams. Fine, I’ll get up but you didn’t have to be a bitch about it. I was gonna get up anyway. Eventually.</p>

<p>I drag myself to the mirror and like, how the fuck do you think I feel about what I see? Dark bags under my eyes like I’m a drug addict, and two day’s worth of beard growth because I felt so gross yesterday that I couldn’t be fucked to even bother shaving. I mean, what’s even the point if I’m just going to look like a dude anyway? At best, maybe I can look like a fag, but you know that’s not really the reason I started transition, is it? No one had any problem with pinning me as a fag before I started transitioning, anyhow.</p>

<p>Whatever. Today, I don’t care about those things. Dysphoria? Ha, who’s she?</p>

<p>I step into the shower, which I’ve grown to have a very love/hate relationship with because I can look down at my feet and BEHOLD! <em>Tits!</em> … and a dick. Yes, this is what I am now. Somewhere between man and woman. A weird transsexual freak.</p>

<p>At least no one can tell if you’re crying when you’re in the shower. Haha!</p>

<p>Shower’s over and I’m feeling like maybe I should try actually combating my dysphoria by trying to look good, instead of just throwing on a depression hoodie like yesterday. I switch on my razor and get to shaving. Little cuts start to appear across my face because that’s just what happens when you shave, I guess? I mean, it’s 2025, you’d think we’d have a better way of shaving without destroying your face but I guess my face is just too sensitive, so fuck me. Better to look a little cut up than to have a beard? I guess?</p>

<p>????</p>

<p>While my face dries from that balm I slather all over my face in the hopes that it’ll prevent my face from turning bright red and bumpy after shaving, but in reality my face still turns red and bumpy only a little bit less so than without it, I look through my wardrobe. It’s really stupid. 70% of my clothes are from pre-transition and I treat them like they’re coated in the bubonic plague. Thing is, plenty of clothes in that 70% are still perfectly fine to wear, but nope. Can’t do it. Won’t do it. They have that filthy fucking boy stench all over them. Instead, I stick to my new clothes that don’t fit me right. You know, the ones designed for hips I don’t have? The ones that assume a bust I don’t have? The ones tailored without a cock in mind? Yes, those.</p>

<p>Last week, a friend asked me why don’t I ever wear a dress? Fair question. A dress wouldn’t have the bulge issue. Still, it’s not going to happen. You will never see me in a dress, I said, not for a very long time. Why not, they asked. I sighed and explained that if I put on a dress and look in the mirror and see a dude in a dress, I think I might just go postal.</p>

<p>If I’m going to try to combat my dysphoria today, I suppose I ought to choose something that’ll make me feel like not-a-dude. How about that skirt that I bought and vowed to never let a single other soul ever see me in because I have a crushingly pathetic sense of self-confidence? Well, I didn’t shave my legs today, so that’s out. Whatever, it’s Sunday and I’m not stepping foot outside. A cami and those pants I bought at H&amp;M that I got really excited about because <em>oh my god I’m wearing girl pants for the first time</em> and then subsequently <em>mortified</em> once I put them on again at home and saw a clear outline of my schlong—yeah, those’ll do. Who cares.</p>

<p>I return to the mirror and push play on my “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ij9kJXUaQmQtFEdo3qnOW">Bad Girl Club</a>” playlist which is supposed to be affirming and empowering, but today it just feels like it’s mocking me for being bad at being a girl. Which, fair enough. I mean, I can’t really argue with that.</p>

<p>Time for makeup. I decide to try a darker eye shadow today to reflect all these capital-F “Feelings” swirling around inside of me, like I’m Robert Pattinson in <em>The Batman</em>, which is a very funny analogy because he is a boy and I am not really. I carelessly smear it over my eyelids and add in some eyeliner with a pen. I’ve never been very good with the pen and today is no exception but fuck it, it doesn’t matter because today I do not care.</p>

<p>Delilah Bon’s aggressively feminist <em>Dead Men Don’t Rape</em> blares out my speakers and girl, it’s a vibe. I don’t know if it’s a good one, but it’s definitely <em>a vibe</em>.</p>

<p>Finished, I look at myself in the mirror. My eye shadow is all over the place and it’s way too dark for my protruding eyebrow bone that already casts my eyes into shadow. My eyeliner looks like a five-year-old’s crayon disasterpiece that they did on the wall while Mommy wasn’t looking. I look like shit. <em>It’s perfect</em>.</p>

<p>Now’s the point in my morning routine where I take a selfie to document my transition. I tell myself this is a really good idea, but so far I’m not really convinced. It mostly just makes me feel worse about myself, if you can believe that, but yesterday I managed to take a photo so today certainly isn’t going to be the day when I fuck up my 150+ day streak. I put on my best bitchy face and flip off the camera, as a notification from the Associated Press pops down: <em>The U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, Trump says, joining Israeli air campaign as Tehran promises to retaliate.</em></p>

<p>Yeah, sure, fuck it. Why not? Not like it’s a surprise, I mean we all knew this was going to happen as soon as Trump started talking in pluralities, right? And what’s another war, anyway? America’s kill count is like its financial debt: too fucking high for anyone to understand or give a shit about. Like, 30 trillion dollars? What does that even <em>mean</em>?</p>

<p>So fuck it, what’s a few more bodies, right? What’s more American than blood in the Middle East?</p>

<p>I’m firmly atheist, except for today. Today, I believe in Hell and I’m in it.</p>

<p><em>Hey Luci</em>, I say with a flirty wave.</p>

<p><em>Hey girlie,</em> he says. His horns look extra delicious today. Damn, he could <em>totally</em> hit, I mean, if he wanted to.</p>

<p><em>Bet you’re loving all this, huh, babe?</em></p>

<p><em>Girl, you don’t even know! That prick is bringing me so much business. We’re having to work overtime just to accommodate all these MAGA fucks!</em></p>

<p><em>That’s great, hun,</em> I say. <em>You gonna have my E ready for me this month?</em></p>

<p><em>Of course, of course,</em> he says with a hand wave. <em>What do you think I am, some kinda shady back alley dealer? I’ve never let you down.</em> He pauses and raises an eyebrow. <em>Assuming you’re good on quota this month?</em></p>

<p><em>Naturally. Wouldn’t dream of shorting you, my dear.</em></p>

<p>He smiles. <em>That’s my girl!</em></p>

<p>(All trans girls get their estrogen from Satan in exchange for spreading the trans agenda. You didn’t know that? Oh my god, that’s <em>so</em> embarrassing for you.)</p>

<p>I sit my bony ass down in front of my computer. What’s nice about the Internet is it makes it easy to hyper-focus, and then I get so absorbed into whatever it is that I’m doing that I start to meld with the 1’s and 0’s and I can leave behind my corporeal flesh. Lately, I’ve been feeling all sorts of emotions which is theoretically what I wanted when I started HRT, but then again maybe not like this? There was a weird, fucked up sense of peace in feeling numb all the time, at least.</p>

<p>Anyway, it doesn’t really matter because I’d sooner fucking die than go back to the way things were before. I still believe this, even if today I’d rather bury myself in the nearest rice paddy for a few years. Maybe the next few decades. It’d save everyone the trouble of digging me a grave. I’d probably be better at being fertilizer than a girl, anyhow.</p>

<p>So, I beg the Internet to bludgeon my senses until I’m a Pretty Girl. Except instead of playing a game or watching YouTube until my brain rots away, today I decide to write—an unusual decision, as I never write on the weekends. However, today I have Important Words that must be expressed. It’s <em>imperative</em> that the three people that read the things I write hear about-</p>

<p>Well actually, given the horrifying headline I just received on my phone, this isn’t important in the slightest. But what else am I, a sad bitch in her sadder apartment, going to do? No, today I write because fuck you.</p>

<p>I navigate to some pretentious blog with a cat in a coffee cup as its logo and start a new post. I give it some dramatic and slightly provocative title, and a subtitle containing a reference that most people probably won’t even get because I guess I like to see how far I can crawl up my own ass.</p>

<p>I’ll look at it later and roll my eyes, I’m sure.</p>

<p>But today, I do not give a fuck.</p>]]></content><author><name>sage-leaf</name></author><category term="trans" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The coup will be televised.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/the-coup-will-be-televised/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The coup will be televised." /><published>2025-06-19T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2025-06-19T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/the-coup-will-be-televised</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/the-coup-will-be-televised/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557992260-ec58e38d363c?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxuZXdzJTIwZmlyZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3NDk3ODU5NzF8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" alt="man sitting on chair holding newspaper on fire" /></p>

<p>Corpses pile up in the Middle East, in 4K they’re caught<br />
Don’t you dare call it a genocide<br />
Lest you’re shipped off to CECOT</p>

<p>In Europe, drones buzz overhead<br />
Death following in their wake<br />
The world looks on and goes to bed<br />
Later donates to the cause for a tax break</p>

<p>Eleven slain in Graz<br />
Cold on the classroom floor<br />
There’s no just cause<br />
Never enough uproar</p>

<p>The Witch Queen sits upon her throne<br />
With a proud smirk and cigar in hand<br />
All the while the dolls groan —<br />
Just as planned</p>

<p>Airplanes falling from the sky<br />
We hebben een serieus probleem<br />
Blame it on DEI<br />
I’ll light the candelabrum</p>

<p>Bro’s got worms<br />
But he’s in charge of our health?<br />
Probably doesn’t even believe in germs<br />
(Or the commonwealth)</p>

<p>The leader of the free world perverts and goads<br />
While the spaceman grovels at his feet<br />
Oh dear, the girls have reached a crossroads!<br />
As protests erupt in the street</p>

<p>Ghouls prowl our neighborhoods, trying to look tough<br />
Looking for the scary brown men<br />
Or anyone close enough</p>

<p>Fires rage in the city of angels<br />
For the second time this year<br />
The media is taking all kinds of weird angles<br />
Should probably stick to the blogosphere</p>

<p>More blood for the Blood God<br />
Lights, camera, bitch, smile<br />
I’ll wait for you to applaud<br />
As the chain gang marches single file</p>

<p>Another casualty<br />
Time for another meme<br />
We treat everything so casually<br />
You can watch it all on a live stream</p>

<p>Blood on the pavement<br />
Gas in the air<br />
Mass displacement<br />
It’s fucking everywhere</p>

<p>Dreams soured<br />
Everything is in decline<br />
Feeling like a coward<br />
Six thousand miles away from the front line.</p>]]></content><author><name>sage-leaf</name></author><category term="poetry" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Photo by Nijwam Swargiary on Unsplash]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Humbly, I kneel before your altar.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/humbly-i-kneel-before-your-altar/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Humbly, I kneel before your altar." /><published>2025-06-12T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2025-06-12T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/humbly-i-kneel-before-your-altar</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/humbly-i-kneel-before-your-altar/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1727448826555-de5a31dc675a?q=80&amp;w=2340&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" alt="portrait of woman in art gallery" /></p>

<p>As the sun rises, so do I.<br />
Tired and weary, I drag myself to the altar<br />
hoping to meet my muse.<br />
Some days they readily greet me.<br />
Others, they are silent and unseen.</p>

<p>In her absence, I look elsewhere<br />
to false idols.<br />
Thinking, <em>that could be me</em>.<br />
But I’m left wanting,<br />
insufficient, always inadequate;<br />
never enough.</p>

<p>I should know better.<br />
Many a Sunday I heard the tale of the irreverent Nebuchadnezzar,<br />
his blasphemy an allegory<br />
for the pitfalls of a false ideology.</p>

<p>But what else am I to do when left to my own devices?</p>

<p>In these moments, disturbing thoughts obscure my vision.<br />
Hypotheticals, as my mind is wont to do.</p>

<p>What if this is it?<br />
What if this is all there is?<br />
What if this is all I am?<br />
Could I accept that?</p>

<p>I don’t think so.<br />
I have to be more.</p>

<p>O Lord, I don’t know who I am anymore.<br />
Once upon a time, I had a clear vision of who I thought I was<br />
but I fear it was merely a fantasy.</p>

<p>Am I a boy?<br />
Surely not!<br />
Am I a girl?<br />
Next question.</p>

<p>To love me is to undergo an overwhelming metamorphosis.<br />
Bravery and strength —<br />
these things demanded of me, yet I am wholly lacking.</p>

<p>I am not strong<br />
and I am not brave.<br />
I am fucking terrified.</p>

<p>I am nothing but meek and small<br />
despite my above-average frame,<br />
a cruel joke from an even crueler creator.</p>

<p>If I kneel at your altar and clasp my hands,<br />
will you light the way?</p>

<p>If I bow my head and surrender my worries,<br />
will you teach me the truth?</p>

<p>If I confess my sins and expel jealously from my heart,<br />
will you breathe life into this flesh?</p>

<p>I feel weaker than I’ve ever been,<br />
unsure if I can bear this weight until its destination.<br />
Sometimes I wish I could go back to the way things used to be —<br />
everything was simpler then.</p>

<p>But this I know to be true:<br />
willful ignorance may have been easy,<br />
but it was a product of the serpent’s conniving tongue.<br />
Nothing but Death awaited in that place.</p>

<p>Enshrouded in a thick gloom,<br />
faith is difficult to sustain.<br />
At times, it’s all I can do to stop myself from screaming.</p>

<p>Then I think about your teachings<br />
your awesome image<br />
your warm bosom —<br />
to be in your charge is to be loved<br />
and realize this has all been worth it.</p>

<p>In you, I entrust my everything.</p>]]></content><author><name>sage-leaf</name></author><category term="poetry" /><category term="trans" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Photo by Moutaman Kamal on Unsplash]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">38,880,000 seconds and counting.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/38880000-seconds-and-counting/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="38,880,000 seconds and counting." /><published>2025-06-05T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2025-06-05T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/38880000-seconds-and-counting</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/38880000-seconds-and-counting/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551892644-51a6e2e8fc65?q=80&amp;w=994&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" alt="taper candle on cupcake" /></p>

<p>Today is your birthday,<br />
although I will make no calls,<br />
send no texts,<br />
offer no gifts.</p>

<p>I’d like to,<br />
but we don’t talk anymore.</p>

<p>It’s been 450 days<br />
or 10,800 hours<br />
or 648,000 minutes<br />
since we last spoke.</p>

<p>I can’t pretend to understand what happened.</p>

<p>Was it something I said?<br />
Did I miss a critical social cue?<br />
Did I do something to offend you?</p>

<p>Or was it simply time for us to end?</p>

<p>I still think back to the time we spent together:<br />
the late night phone calls,<br />
the conversations about boys,<br />
the aimless strolls through the woods<br />
where the alligator lady dwelt.</p>

<p>I still think back to photosynthesis.</p>

<p>Of course,<br />
there were the arguments,<br />
and the bickering,<br />
and the accusations,<br />
and …</p>

<p>I cannot deny these past 450 days have been less complicated,<br />
less stressful,<br />
generally easier<br />
as result of your absence.</p>

<p>And yet, they’ve been all the more lonely.</p>

<p>Times are scary;<br />
are you well?<br />
We left off on a cliffhanger;<br />
are you married now?<br />
Did you finally get your own place?</p>

<p>Are you happy?<br />
I hope so.</p>

<p>I really do.</p>

<p>In our last conversation<br />
you lamented that I never seemed happy.<br />
But look at me now!<br />
I wish you were here to meet me —<br />
the real me.</p>

<p>You never had a chance to meet Sage,<br />
and that’s a shame.<br />
(for both of us)<br />
I think you would’ve liked her.</p>

<p>But maybe our separation was necessary for us to grow.<br />
Maybe we needed to shed the past<br />
to move forward in the present;<br />
maybe we were just collateral.</p>

<p>I wish things ended differently.<br />
I wish they never ended at all,<br />
but I would’ve settled<br />
for ending things on an amicable note.</p>

<p>Despite the biting words,<br />
the hurt feelings,<br />
the hole left in your wake;<br />
despite everything,<br />
I wish you well.</p>

<p>Happy birthday.</p>]]></content><author><name>sage-leaf</name></author><category term="poetry" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Photo by Angèle Kamp on Unsplash]]></summary></entry></feed>
