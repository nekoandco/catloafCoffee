I’ve spent the past month-and-a-half learning HTML, CSS and some other stuff to create this site—no website building tool here! It’s been a really fun learning process, and it wasn’t as difficult as I thought it would be.</p>

<p>I’m quite happy with how the site turned out. Since I have full access to the site’s code, I have full control over its styling and format, and I can do custom styling for specific pages. Pop over to the <a href="/about">about page</a>, for example.</p>

<h2 id="why-leave-substack">Why leave Substack?</h2>

<p><strong>This blog has never been interested in building an audience.</strong> If I cared to get a bunch of eyeballs on my writing, I wouldn’t write 5,000+ word posts or publish weird, sometimes experimental, obtuse poetry (that maybe isn’t even very good). Regardless, <strong>Substack is ultimately a social platform</strong>. Appended to each of my posts were like and comment counters, and every time I opened its dashboard to post my writing, I was greeted with graphs showing all sorts of social metrics. While ultimately I don’t care, seeing a graph of dwindling readership just doesn’t feel good. This new site does not have any of this. It is simply a place for my words to live, as I had originally intended this blog to be when I started it over a year ago. It will almost certainly mean significantly less readership than I had already, but I won’t know for sure. Out of sight, out of mind.</p>

<p>However, <strong>the main reason</strong> I moved my writing off Substack shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone who is familiar with the happenings on that platform. <strong>Substack has a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/07/substacks-nazi-problem-wont-go-away-after-push-notification-apology/">history of sympathizing with Nazis</a></strong>, and that’s putting it rather charitably. Just a few months ago, a notification was pushed to many of the Substack app’s users, that directed them to a blog adorned with swastikas. A system error? I’m not eager to lend Substack the benefit of the doubt, given its past handling of similar situations.</p>

<p>I’m Autistic and trans—<em>have you heard?</em>—and live in a world that is currently frothing at the mouth to do a genocide on people like me. From RFK Jr. making up the dumbest bullshit you’ve ever heard about Autism and vaccines, to the President’s nonstop attacks against trans rights—every time I open the news I’m greeted with a fresh wave of hate aimed directly at me. We are in a genuine crisis. The last thing I want is for my writing—what represents my most personal inner thoughts and feelings—put up alongside hate-filled rhetoric advocating for the eradication of my people. Full stop.</p>

<p>I considered moving to another platform, but I didn’t find anything that I was especially happy with. And who’s to say I wouldn’t run into the same issue with another platform down the line? We see more and more bending over to fascism every single day. Instead, I decided to just make my own website where I have full control over my writing, where it appears, and how it is presented.</p>

<p><strong>Eventually, catloaf &amp; coffee will be deleted entirely from Substack.</strong> If you chose to join me on this new site, welcome! There are no comments here, but you can find my email on every page of this site in the footer, if you ever want to say hello.</p>

<p>Stay safe. It’s pretty fucked up out there.</p>

<p>That place, a vampire<br />
Only the dead persist there<br />
Linger too long and join their ranks</p>

<p>They prey on those filled of hope<br />
With spirits unbroken<br />
Till nothing is left but a lifeless husk</p>

<p>At night they prowl<br />
Looking for the brightest of sparks<br />
Innocence makes the nectar sweeter</p>

<p>Deep do their fangs penetrate<br />
Crimson oozing down their chin<br />
Just another victim of circumstance</p>

<p>Seen it happen too many times<br />
Lost many a friend to that place<br />
Promised myself I wouldn’t meet the same fate</p>

<p>Felt myself withering<br />
Knew I couldn’t stay<br />
So I turned my back on everything</p>

<p>Under false pretenses I fled<br />
Claimed the spirit of adventure<br />
To elude suspicion</p>

<p>Found sanctuary in the unlikeliest of places<br />
Here, too, monsters roam the streets<br />
Just as lethal, somehow more manageable</p>

<p>Script has been flipped<br />
I am hunter, they are hunted<br />
Still I am not at ease</p>

<p>The beating of wings echoes on the horizon<br />
In the dark they creep closer<br />
It won’t be much longer now</p>

<p>Years they scoured the earth<br />
Looking for the one who escaped their grasp<br />
Sin so unforgivable, it cannot go unpunished</p>

<p>Trained for this moment, yet<br />
Fear clutches at my heart<br />
Though I will run no longer</p>

<p>Come, ye beasts!<br />
Come, ye vampires!<br />
Come, ye creatures of the night!</p>

<p>Unfinished business we must attend<br />
Ready thy fangs<br />
Prepare to meet thy maker<br />
<br /></p>

<p>It’s funny<br />
They told you the truth<br />
Yet you kept on pretending like nothing happened</p>

<p>To be honest<br />
I don’t care about collateral anymore<br />
I’m ready to raze it all to the ground<br />
Just give me a reason</p>

<p>I’ll relish in the flames<br />
Let the fires warm my heart<br />
Watch the embers drift by<br />
Twinkling like fireflies<br />
Raise my arms high in victory<br />
And declare, <em>Liberation!</em></p>

<p>I’ve been dreaming of my demise since I turned nine<br />
Never thought I’d make it this far</p>

<p>Crawled from the deepest of depths<br />
Against all odds<br />
Bloody and broken<br />
And yet I remain</p>

<p>I wasn’t given a choice<br />
It was this or a noose<br />
I chose life</p>

<p>My existence<br />
An act of defiance<br />
A warning to any who dare stand in my way<br />
I will be denied no longer</p>

<p>Still you don’t understand what this is<br />
Still you fail to grasp the implications<br />
Still you refuse to recognize your complicity<br />
Still you shield your eyes from the pain you wrought</p>

<p>I am bitter<br />
I am angry<br />
I am hate</p>

<p>I have been denied life<br />
I have been denied a childhood<br />
I have been denied peace</p>

<p>You have denied me an identity<br />
For the sake of your ancient ideologies<br />
And absurd ideas about who I am or what I should be<br />
As if you had any fucking right</p>

<p>You, who cannot see the forest for the trees<br />
You, who is incapable of reckoning with their own behavior<br />
You, who has utterly failed to uphold the values you claim so dear<br />
You.</p>

<p>For this, you will be the recipient of my fury</p>

<p>Beware<br />
This is my calling card<br />
Deny me and be doomed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><br />
Ere long you will lose that which you cannot replace</p>

<p>Soon we’ll be bathed in illustrious flame<br />
Flesh will give way to bone<br />
Bone will turn to ash<br />
And at last, I will be rid of you</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">⚠️ J.K. Rowling</div>

<p>It’s Sunday. I’m visiting some family in Tokyo. The air is sweltering but I’m taking refuge at a small, beat-up dining table in my aunt’s and uncle’s house. Five of us are huddled around the table, eating French toast under a wall-mounted air conditioner unit. It softly hums away while the kids watch YouTube on an iPad and the adults deliberate what to do with our day.</p>

<p>We float through a few ideas, but nothing really sticks. How about that Godzilla exhibit, I say. Someone says they don’t like Godzilla. We could do teamLab,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> my uncle offers. Ah, never mind, tickets are sold-out. My aunt suggests Takeshita-dori.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> No one seems interested. What about a movie, my uncle proposes. No one even dignifies that with a response.</p>

<p>My uncle’s family is in Tokyo only temporarily. I’ve been visiting them each month, trying to make good use of the time that we have together. It’s been nice seeing my cousins. We’ve always been so far apart from each other—always on different hemispheres—that we’ve barely had any opportunities to interact.</p>

<p>Most of the contact I’ve had with them was when they were born. When I was in high school, I held the oldest in my arms right after he was born, and I saw the youngest for the first time over a video call when I was a freshman in university. She was so tiny then. Now, they’re both right in front of me watching a <em>Minecraft</em> “Let’s Play,” faces sticky from maple syrup. Babies no more. I feel old.</p>

<p>I have lots of these kinds of moments nowadays: Something reminds me of something else that in my mind is just a year-or-two old and then I realize it’s actually more like a full decade old except I can clearly remember when it was new and then I feel ancient and then I start to panic about my mortality and how I’ll be hitting 30 in just a couple of years and how I absolutely cannot be 30 and still a boy which shouldn’t actually be a problem because I’m transitioning but like, what if my transition is a failure?</p>

<p>I’m spiraling. I tell myself to calm down; that it’s a ridiculous thing to be having an existential crisis over some French toast at a comically small dining table at 10:30 in the morning. Deep breaths. Okay. I’m okay. I return to the present. We’ve still not settled on a plan for the day. I should probably think of some more ideas, else we might actually be here all day at this damn table. I love my uncle’s family, but settling on plans doesn’t seem to be their strong suit.</p>

<p>I know lots of places in Tokyo but I don’t normally have to consider children. Hmm. What do kids like? (God, I’m so old.) Well, my students love Harry Potter, and there’s that studio tour somewhere in Tokyo that we could go—the one with all the recreated sets from the movies that you can walk around on.</p>

<p>I ask if the kids like Harry Potter. They love Harry Potter, my uncle says. I tell him about the studio tour. He asks the kids if they want to go. The oldest says it sounds cool. The youngest asks what is Harry Potter?</p>

<p>They’ll love it, my uncle says, let’s do that.</p>

<p>We purchase tickets online, but our entry time is still a few hours away—a commonly used crowd-control tactic in Japan. We decide to bide our time by heading into Shinjuku for lunch and seeing the Godzilla statue there, because the kids haven’t seen it before.</p>

<p>Wait, didn’t someone say they don’t like Godzilla? I guess they changed their mind? I can’t keep up.</p>

<p>We take the train into Shinjuku. It is dirty and smells like shit, which is unusual for Tokyo but not for Shinjuku which is lined with bars as far as the eye can see. It’s not uncommon to stumble upon a puddle of vomit in the street here. It’s a lovely place.</p>

<p>While I guide everyone to the monster’s lair, the kids complain about the heat. It <em>is</em> hot. My clothes are starting to stick to my skin. I’m holding my pastel-pink umbrella aloft to provide some shade, but I can feel the band of my sports bra getting wetter by the second as beads of sweat run down my back. We haven’t even been outside for ten minutes. I love this country, but damn, is the summer intolerable.</p>

<p>Soon, we reach the famed Toho movie theatre with the great <em>kaiju</em> peaking over its top. A massive claw rests atop the theatre’s roof and a familiar round noggin floats above it. Its jaws are fixed open, frozen in a menacing grin. With its red eyes, it glares at the people meandering in the street below, going about their lives as if there isn’t a giant 20-story tall monster about to annihilate them all.</p>

<div class="caption"><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jieyeu">Jie Yeu Teoh</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-city-street-filled-with-lots-of-tall-buildings-lOmsiNYE_o0">Unsplash</a></div>
<p>I happen to visit this theatre semi-regularly, so I’ve seen this sight a few dozen times before but I must admit, it <em>is</em> pretty cool. The kids think so, too, but only for about twenty seconds, after which we’re all standing on the street corner like, yep. That’s Godzilla.</p>

<p>It’s noon, so we head underground in pursuit of someplace to eat lunch. We settle on a restaurant that serves various standard Japanese-fare—<em>okonomiyaki</em>, <em>yakisoba</em>, and so on—and wait in line. Japan loves to queue. When people think of the Japanese Experience, they think of <em>geisha</em> and <em>kimono</em> and temples and <em>sakura</em>. But in reality, it often looks like staring at the back of a stranger’s head for hours on end—not exactly the exotic paradise everyone hopes for.</p>

<p>Waiting in line means we’re idle, and anyone who’s ever been around children knows that being idle is a very bad thing, indeed. Idle kids get bored, and bored kids aren’t something that anyone really wants, so my aunt takes the youngest to go look at some other restaurants in an attempt to bide our time, but this is an obvious rookie mistake. Article 237-C of the Hammurabi Code clearly states that one should never deviate from a plan once it is agreed upon by all children present. (Probably.)</p>

<p>Anyway, it’s too late. The restaurant we’re queueing at is deemed no longer acceptable.</p>

<p>The new plan is a curry and <em>onigiri</em> joint around the corner. We surrender our place in line and march over to this new place, and a problem immediately presents itself: it’s <em>tiny</em>. There’s no way the five of us could fit in there. So what now? Do we go back to the restaurant we just left? No, that’s stupid. And we’ve wasted so much time in our failed pursuit of food, that there isn’t much time left before we need to head to the studio tour.</p>

<p>Let’s just grab some onigiri and head over, my uncle says. We just ate breakfast, anyway.</p>

<p><em>Well</em>, this girlie is going through puberty again, and she could eat a whole-ass bear or two despite the French toast from a couple of hours ago. But she’s also a <em>lady</em>, so she’ll keep quiet about this to preserve the integrity of our expedition.</p>

<p>I sigh, but not loud enough for anyone to hear. I must express my dissatisfaction, but not in a confrontational way because I know I’m being a little unreasonable—just enough to make myself feel a little better about my lack of agency.</p>

<p>My uncle guides us through Shinjuku’s underbelly for like, 20 minutes to find an onigiri stand, which is odd considering onigiri is a dime-a-dozen in this country and we passed approximately 83 onigiri stands on the way to this one. This particular stand has a specialty for spicy tuna onigiri, which the kids seem excited about, at least. I reluctantly choose an onigiri made of fried rice, making sure to take a half-second longer to order so as to express my displeasure at this whole turn of events. We wolf down our snacks, then head over to the tour’s venue.</p>

<p>The site of “Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo”—a name so obviously terrible it comes paired with a more descriptive subtitle, “The Making of Harry Potter,” which makes for an absurdly long title in full—is rather unassuming. A well-manicured lawn dotted with minimalist sculptures resembling various iconography from the Harry Potter films stretches out in front of a rather boring, boxy building. The only dead giveaway that we’re in the right place is the large Harry Potter logo above the entrance.</p>

<p>Yes, I kind of fucked up. We’re in Tokyo, one of the largest cities in the world, a place that <em>really does have it all</em>—and I bring everyone to the Harry Potter studio tour, of all places. We’re here because of <em>me</em>. <em>I</em> did this. Why is a trans girl suggesting we go somewhere built in honor of an IP that’s the product of <em>the</em> reigning TERF bitch? Look, estrogen makes you pretty, not smart. I wanted to see the kids happy and I panicked, okay? We couldn’t decide on anything, it’s our last weekend together before everyone leaves, and I just wanted to have a good time. I know I fucked up. I know.</p>

<p>And I’m regretting it already. Seeing that massive logo looming above me makes me feel strange, a bit uncomfortable. As we wait in line—because this is Japan, remember, we love to queue here—I look around me and everyone seems pretty damn straight and very cisgender. Meanwhile, here I am in a full face of makeup, a pink T-shirt with a cute cartoon bear on it, and breezy bottoms that no cisgender man would ever wear.</p>

<p>The Harry Potter logo looks upon me with disgust. <em>Tranny,</em> it jeers.</p>

<p>Shut up, Harry Potter logo. You’re just a sign.</p>

<p>While our tickets are scanned one-by-one, I anxiously consider what the insides of this building might contain. I hope it’ll be like the <em>Harry Potter 20th Anniversary</em> reunion, where everyone talked <em>around</em> J. K. Rowling, and anytime she did pop onscreen it was paired with a disclaimer that the segment was filmed years ago, as if the filmmakers were profusely apologizing for having to include her at all.</p>

<p>Yeah, I hope it’s like that.</p>

<p>It’s not like that. As soon as we enter the building, we’re greeted with a quote from one of the books, prominently displayed on a large banner and proudly attributed to the queen bitch herself. Oh god, what I have done.</p>

<p>We enter the main lobby: a cavernous carpeted space littered with benches and large LED displays running the length of its walls. To our left is a gift shop styled in the Ministry of Magic’s iconic green-and-black tile, to our right is a food court themed like Hogwarts’ Great Hall, and immediately ahead is a shadowy hole in the wall. Next to it sits a sign that reads, STUDIO TOUR ENTRANCE. We head straight there. I look longingly in the food court’s direction the whole way.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/studioTourMap.jpg" alt="map of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo" /></p>
<div class="caption">A map of Warner Bros. Studio Tour Tokyo. It fails to convey how truly massive a space it is. (Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.)</div>

<p>Beyond the ominous entrance lie massive on-set photos from each Harry Potter film, presented with a 3D-layered effect. My youngest cousin asks why there are cameras visible in some of the pictures, as if the tour creators made a glaring oversight. It’s a <em>studio</em> tour, I explain, we get to see how the movies were made! Oh, she says.</p>

<p>She’s adorable.</p>

<p>We’re corralled by staff into a dark rectangular room plastered with movie posters all along the front wall. My aunt points out one of the posters with Johnny Depp, and I say I don’t remember him in any of the films. He was in one of the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> movies, she says. Oh, I say, I never saw those. She puffs out her bottom lip. That’s a shame, she says. They’re fun!</p>

<p>On the back wall is a row of portraits of all the films’ directors. At the end of the lineup is a familiar face: J. K. Rowling, with that stupid smirk that she always makes in photos. Can’t she just smile like a normal person? It isn’t that hard, girl.</p>

<p>I consider taking a picture of myself flipping off her portrait, but quickly abandon the idea as a large mass of people pushes into the space. The doors ahead are closed and we’re all standing around looking at these movie posters we’ve all seen a million times before. A staff member monologues about each of the posters. It’s very boring and very long. I’m not paying much attention because it’s all being conducted in Japanese and I don’t feel like applying my brain right now, and also I can’t shake the feeling of the hole being bored into my head from J. K. Rowling’s smug mug behind me.</p>

<p>Finally, the doors ahead are opened. Can we actually start the tour now? Nope. Instead, we’re being corralled into another dark and rectangular space. This room has a long LED screen spanning the width of the far wall, that shows Harry’s Japanese voice actor explaining the tour’s rules and teasing all the things we’re about to see.</p>

<p>Like, yeah dude, just let us see for ourselves. You don’t have to sell us on this. We’ve bought tickets already. Let us in!</p>

<p>The presentation ends with clips of fans dressed in wizard robes talking about what Harry Potter means to them. It feels like some weird corporate diversity video meant to show that <em>Harry Potter is for everyone</em>! I look around me. The room is very crowded—there’s probably a couple hundred people in here—but there’s not a single queer-presenting person in the room, save for me. I want to melt into a puddle and seep into the floor.</p>

<p>The doors ahead are opened and at last we can start- oh for fuck’s sake, Warner Brothers! Another dark rectangular room? I’m beginning to think this tour is just one big practical joke.</p>

<p>This room is much larger. It’s a cinema, complete with a large projection screen and several rows of theatre seats. We seat ourselves in the front row and Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson (<em>queen</em>) appear onscreen to give an introduction to the tour. If my math is correct, this is now the third introduction to the tour (that everyone has already paid real money to attend) that we’re being subjected to. We “started” the tour 30 minutes ago. The kids are growing a little impatient. I am too.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this introduction is shorter than the others. The theatre screen is raised into the ceiling, and <em>behold!</em> The entrance doors to Hogwarts. It’s pretty cool, I must admit. We all crowd around the doors, and a staff member asks the crowd if anyone is celebrating a birthday or an anniversary. No one responds. He asks again. No one responds. He asks again. No one responds. He nervously chuckles to himself.</p>

<p>Refusing to be deterred, he asks for like, the fifth time. A child raises his hand and pushes through the crowd. The kid is maybe 12 years old. The staff member asks, <em>completely sincerely</em>, if today is his birthday or anniversary. I burst out laughing. No one else in the crowd offers even a hint of a laugh.</p>

<p>Kill me, kill me, kill me.</p>

<p>The kid is instructed to push open the doors at the count of three, but he doesn’t seem to understand much Japanese, and this staff member doesn’t know how to handle this. (I mean, who could possibly have foreseen that the big Harry Potter attraction would bring in overseas guests?) Eventually, they figure it out and the tour is allowed to begin at last. We shuffle through the double doors and into a recreation of Hogwarts’ Great Hall.</p>

<p>True to its name, it is pretty great. The floor is made of (fake) large stone slabs and the ceiling is simply bare lighting, just like the actual film set because the hall’s ceiling was added in post. The walls are lined with the hall’s iconic dining tables, and at each house’s section are mannequins donning their respective robes. At the far end of the hall, where the school’s staff would sit, is the Goblet of Fire. Two mannequins resembling Fred and George Weasley with long white beards are sprawled out on the floor in front of the artifact, recreating the scene from the fourth film.</p>

<p>A staff member approaches the goblet, introduces it, and then a burst of blue fire erupts from the goblet’s mouth. A little slip of paper shoots out from inside it and the staff member catches it in midair, gasps, and shows the paper to the crowd. It reads HARRY POTTER. Everyone claps. It’s very <em>sugoi</em>.</p>

<p>The kids are loving it. They’re excitedly bouncing around the hall, ooh-ing and ahh-ing at every little thing. There’s nothing quite like being a kid.</p>

<p>What’s that, the youngest asks. She points at some mannequins in green-and-black robes. That’s the Slytherin house, my uncle replies. They look bad, she says. Yeah, I say, they’re pretty bad. She bounces away to look at something else.</p>

<p>Once we’ve had our fill of the Great Hall, we move into the following rooms. We’re greeted with a behind-the-scenes look at the hall’s construction and then a room highlighting the iconic moving marble staircase. It’s been rebuilt here and it actually moves!</p>

<p>Next, is a large space showcasing the sets of the living areas at Hogwarts. There’s the Gryffindor and Slytherin common rooms, dorms, and Dumbledore’s office. Everything is just as I remember it from the films. Oh, there’s the fireplace where Harry spoke to Sirius in <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>! There’s where Ron and Harry argued about girls in <em>Goblet of Fire</em>. That’s the sword Harry uses in <em>Chamber of Secrets</em>.</p>

<p>Across from the Slytherin common room is an area where you can become spectators in a Quidditch match. The five of us are grouped up with about 15 others and are led onto a small set resembling the spectator stands from the films. We’re coached through various reactions while being filmed, then we’re guided to a display that shows a Quidditch scene from <em>Philosopher’s Stone</em> with our reactions cut in. It’s horribly cheesy, but the kids are going crazy for it.</p>

<p>I can’t stop looking at myself, though. Jesus Christ, I look like that? The camera caught me from a 45-degree angle and my side profile is dreadful. It’s so angular. It screams “man.” Gross. I feel sick.</p>

<p>Trying to hide my disgust, I cower in the back while everyone else laughs at the ridiculous edit on the display. After what feels like an eternity, the video ends and I shove past everyone, then hide in the Room of Requirement. Bad move. Everything here is reflective, and now I’m staring at my distorted face in various pots and pans. Ugly, ugly, ugly, they chant.</p>

<p>It would be brilliant if I could stop thinking about being trans for just a single minute. Every waking second of my existence is consumed with obsessive thoughts about how I look, how I sound, how I stand, how I walk, how I act. I look at everyone around me and compare myself to them, which is a very stupid thing to do, but as I previously established, this girlie isn’t the brightest.</p>

<p>And like, everyone in Tokyo is <em>so hot</em>. Both the women and the men. Everyone has these perfectly crafted outfits, glowing skin, and gorgeous hair. I want to be friends with all of them and learn their secrets. I want to date all of them and kiss them. I want to <em>be</em> them.</p>

<p>Then there’s me standing in front of an old chrome pot, staring at my warped face. I look like a blobfish.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/mrBlobby.jpg" alt="blobfish" title="it me" /></p>
<div class="caption">An actual picture of what I look like. Weren’t expecting a face reveal, I bet. (Kerryn Parkinson, <i>NORFANZ Expedition</i>)</div>

<p>The next part of the tour focuses on the learning environments at Hogwarts: Defense Against the Dark Arts and Potions classrooms, and the library. Wedged in between the classroom sets is the Mirror of Erised, in which Harry sees his parents in <em>Philosopher’s Stone</em>. At the studio tour, it’s been turned into a selfie opportunity. An orderly queue (I really wasn’t lying about Japan loving to queue) rests off to the side, with a long line of visitors patiently waiting for their turn. My aunt and uncle want a photo with everyone, so we take a place at the end of the line.</p>

<p>I am not thrilled about this, but what am I going to do? I’ve been running into this issue for my entire life: I’ve always <em>hated</em> taking photos, for reasons that should be obvious, but if I object to taking a photo everyone acts as if I personally insulted their mothers. I’ve learned to shut up and just go along with it. It’s easier that way.</p>

<p>As we wait for our turn, I try my best to dissociate. It works. Now I’m numb and I don’t really care about having to look at my reflection again. I watch my body from some high vantage point as we stand in front of the mirror. We smile, my uncle takes a couple of pictures, and then we give up our spot to the next group in line. My uncle shows us the photos. Everyone is smiling perfectly, looking so happy.</p>

<p>Isn’t it strange that we always smile in photos, even if we aren’t actually happy in the moment? We willingly choose to alter our memories of events, warping them with false records because god forbid we remember things as they actually happened. Our camera rolls depict much happier images of our lives than what actually occurred. It’s never made sense to me. The false smiles of mine that permeate the majority of the photos ever taken of me only remind me of just how unhappy or uncomfortable I actually was at the time. I can look at photos and recall the bullshit behind each smile: In this one, I said I didn’t want to be in the picture, and then there was a big argument about it right before we took the picture. Oh, in this one, I look super happy but really I was thinking about going home and hanging myself. Good times!</p>

<p>We proceed into the Forbidden Forest. Thick, towering trees surround us. The ground is a soft, squishy rubber made to look like dirt. In here, there are no reflective surfaces and everything is cast into shadow, so I’m able to slowly regain my composure. I watch the kids run about the forest, giggling with excitement. Screens are hung on the walls in between the trees to create the illusion of dementors flying through the woods. You can stand in front of these screens and mime a patronus charm to ward off the creatures. It’s a big hit with the kids.</p>

<p>After braving an encounter with the forest’s eight-legged inhabitants, we’re spit outside in front of Hagrid’s hut and a café behind it. A staff member informs us we’re at the halfway-point of the tour. Damn. We’ve spent nearly three hours here already.</p>

<p>We decide to eat lunch. For real this time. The café serves a host of themed foods, mostly consisting of British cuisine. I order the Slytherin plate: bangers and mash and an oolong tea. It’s <em>fine</em>. Definitely overpriced, but this is to be expected at a venue like this.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/cafeMenu.png" alt="Backlot Cafe menu" /></p>
<div class="caption">¥2,900 for mashed potatoes, peas, and a curly sausage? It’s a bit expensive by Tokyo standards. (Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.)</div>

<p>Before we commence the second half of the tour, I stop by the restroom. I hang a right to the men’s restroom because I’m not looking to start an <em>incident</em>, and lock myself in a stall. I hang my bag on the door’s hook and feel around inside for my mirror and lipstick, carefully reapply it, then brush my hair. This is a bit silly, really. There’s a huge mirror right outside, but instead I’m choosing to hide in a smelly stall to do my touch-ups. I’m still going to be walking around in the men’s restroom in a full face of makeup and feminine attire, but I guess it’s a step too far to openly reapply my lipstick.</p>

<p>Anxiety is stupid.</p>

<p>We resume our tour and arrive at Platform 9 ¾. The noble Hogwarts Express sits proudly at the station, steam billowing from its smokestack, impressing with its tremendous size. I stand in the middle of the platform, full of visitors going to-and-fro just like a real train platform, and it hits me:</p>

<p>Little Sage is <em>loving</em> this. She’s fan-girling <em>so hard</em> right now. This whole tour is basically all she ever wanted. Harry Potter was <em>everything</em> to me. I adored the books, and when I saw the movies it was like a religious experience. To now be walking around in the very spaces I read about is a dream come true.</p>

<p>Because they weren’t just books. They were a window to another world, another reality. A place where even the mundane was wondrous. A place where anything could—and did—happen. The Wizarding World was everything the real world wasn’t: Thrilling. Exciting. Happy. I wanted so badly to live there, and for most of my elementary school years I basically did.</p>

<p>I never had many friends. I still don’t. As it turns out, being Autistic and actually a girl (even though no one sees it, really) doesn’t make for a wealth of popularity. But at Hogwarts, I had Harry, Ron, and Hermione. I was right there with them—running all over the school grounds, getting into wacky hijinks, fighting Death Eaters, and drinking Butterbeer. They weren’t characters. They were <em>my friends</em>, and they accepted me even when no one else would.</p>

<p>But now, it’s all wrong. Here I am on Platform 9 ¾ and I should be over the moon, yet I feel so conflicted. Everywhere on this tour are various quotes from the books, all attributed to J. K. Rowling. Her dumb face pops up in various spots like a jump scare in some throwaway horror flick. She’s inescapable. This world that had played such a pivotal role in my formative years now feels nauseating. Normally, I’m a big proponent of separating the art from the artist, but Harry Potter has been steeped in its creator’s hate-fueled campaign for far too long to ignore. It’s wrong. We shouldn’t have come here. I shouldn’t have come here.</p>

<p>But still the tour continues. Now we’re walking on the green-and-black tiles of the Ministry of Magic. I stand in front of Dolores Umbridge’s pink dress, and it feels strangely fitting because by this point in the story the curtain has been lifted. After a brief stint as headmaster of Hogwarts, Umbridge is now in the belly of the authoritative Ministry of Magic and is no longer hiding her true nefarious nature; just as Rowling isn’t hiding her hatred for people like me. I think of her stupid cigar photo. She may as well be the one in this dress.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/jkrowlingCigar-Censored.jpg" alt="JK Rowling smoking cigar with devil horns and eyes crossed out" title="bitch." /></p>
<div class="caption">Following the UK’s Supreme Court ruling that the term “woman” does not apply to trans women, Rowling posted this image (edits mine) with the caption: “I love it when a plan comes together.” Cunt. (<a href="https://x.com/jk\_rowling/status/1912644919103004807">J.K. Rowling on X</a>)</div>

<p>I don’t know whether I want to scream, cry, or both, but I decide that the cold interior of the Ministry isn’t the place for either of those things. We meander through a section showing how the books’ magical creatures were realized on screen, and then we hop in line for the Broomstick Experience. First, a staff member takes a group photo (ugh) and then whisks us away to a green stall with a broomstick suspended horizontally. My oldest cousin mounts it and is instructed to give various reactions and poses, while he’s superimposed into a scene from <em>Goblet of Fire</em> where Harry flys away from a dragon, except instead of Harry it’s now my cousin. Everyone laughs. The youngest especially.</p>

<p>It’s my uncle’s turn. He makes crazy, exaggerated movements and the kids are bowled over with laughter. He’s a good dad. I’m laughing, too, but only because I’m trying to blend in. Really, I’m dreading being asked to get on the broomstick because I don’t think I can handle seeing myself on camera again.</p>

<p>The staff member motions for me to enter the stall. I politely decline. Everyone seems a little bummed.</p>

<p>I am, too. I feel like a disappointment. I wish I wasn’t like this.</p>

<p>We’re almost finished now. Just two main features to go. After the Broomstick Experience is an exhibit explaining foley-work, and then <em>there it is</em>: Diagon Alley.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/diagonAlley.jpg" alt="Diagon Alley" /></p>
<div class="caption">Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.</div>

<p>Of all the books’ many locales, this is certainly the most whimsical, which is probably why this set was saved for last. Its winding path stretches out in front of us, utilizing a bit of forced perspective that makes it all seem at least twice as big as it really is. Just like in the films, shops are jammed haphazardly together, painted in all sorts of vibrant colors, and constructed in impossible geometry. I waltz over to 93 Diagon Alley, where Weasley &amp; Weasley is located. Inside are endless shelves of multicolored boxes paired with zany signs detailing their contents. In the middle of the shop floor is a statue of a child holding a large bowl containing purple-and-green candies. The statue has a concerningly round head and is hunched over the bowl, mouth unnaturally agape, as a steady flow of the candies expel from its orifice into the bowl. Beside the statue is a sign that reads PUKING PASTILLES. I feel a strange sense of kinship with the thing.</p>

<p>The set is immaculately kept and exhaustively detailed, but I’m quite tired of this place. I’m ready to leave, and not just because I feel <em>weird</em> about being trans at Hogwarts. We’ve been here for over five hours now. As impressively comprehensive a tour as this is, it is <em>so very long</em>.</p>

<p>Luckily, there’s only one stop left in our tour. We pass through a hallway featuring a spread of the Marauder’s Map to the tour’s final chamber. It is a vast, black chamber housing a staggeringly massive model of the Hogwarts grounds in full. It’s difficult to convey the size of it. The room is essentially two or three stories tall. We enter at the top and <em>still</em> the model towers before us. It’s a brilliant finale, even if it does feel hollow.</p>

<p>At long last, our tour has come to a close. We’re spit out into the gift shop, which is inexplicably larger than the Great Hall and Diagon Alley sets combined. I peruse the merchandise while the kids sort through plushies. There are wands, robes, hats, building sets, pins, stationary, confectionaries, Butterbeer, figures—far too much to list off, even if I could remember all of the shop’s offerings. I cannot deny that this stuff is cool. It’s not junk. It’s quality stuff. I would totally buy an irresponsible amount of merch, if it weren’t for J. K. Rowling’s stench plaguing everything in sight.</p>

<p>It’s past six now. We decide we may as well grab dinner before we leave, so we walk to the dining hall styled like Hogwarts’ Great Hall. I order an English breakfast, which like the bangers and mash, is aggressively overpriced. The toast is branded with “9 ¾” in a meager attempt to tie the meal into the theming. It tastes like styrofoam. It’s a bit sad.</p>

<p>I finish my meal before everyone else because I ordered first. In Japan, meals are brought out whenever they’re ready so usually you eat when your food arrives, even if other members in your party are still waiting to receive their order. I watch the kids eat. Somehow, they appear to be getting just as much food in their mouths as on their faces.</p>

<p>Our kids have the worst table manners, my uncle says. I chuckle. It’s gross but also cute, in a little kid sort of way.</p>

<p>Eventually, watching the messy display in front of me grows old, so I look around the room. We’re sat close to where the dining hall meets the main lobby. I look toward the exit. Above it is a quote immortalized in golden letters that reads, WHETHER YOU COME BACK BY PAGE OR BY THE BIG SCREEN, HOGWARTS WILL ALWAYS BE THERE TO WELCOME YOU HOME. In small letters below, the quote’s author is revealed: J. K. Rowling.</p>

<p>Those words were originally spoken nearly 15 years ago, during the premiere of the <em>Deathly Hallows: Part 2</em>. It was a simpler time when the Wizarding World yet lacked the political undertones it carries today. Rowling’s hatred of the trans community wouldn’t come to light until many years later. But in 2025, the quote suspended above takes on a more nuanced meaning: Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you, except for me because I am trans.</p>

<p>I get up from the table and capture the only photo I take of the entire tour. I lazily position the quote in frame and then my right hand with its middle finger extended. Like our group photo at the Mirror of Erised, it paints a false image of the current moment. It implies anger and defiance, but I feel neither of these things. I’m just sad, and tired. Tired of being sad.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/hogwarts/jkrowlingFuckYou.jpg" alt="my middle finger extended to J.K. Rowling's quote" title="bullshit!" /></p>

<p>I look back to my cousins in the dining hall, still painting their faces with their dinner. They’re so innocent, so beautifully oblivious to the sinister bigotry lurking behind everything around us. They are free to run about and take everything at face-value. They don’t have to hyper-analyze everything for its subtext, or consider whether they should even be here at all. Hogwarts is just a magical school from some old movies. Dobby is just a funny little guy. J. K. Rowling is just a face on a wall. I envy them.</p>

<p>For many trans people—and Autistics, of which I am one—childhood is a blur. I don’t remember my childhood much. I remember only a few things: a constant state of unease, the resulting persistent desire to no longer exist, weirdness from growing up in the church. It’s difficult to recall anything especially positive, but Harry Potter has always been one of the few exceptions. Now, I don’t even have that.</p>

<p>We exit the tour building. The front lawn is now illuminated by moonlight. As we walk to the nearby train station, my aunt asks if I’ll finally watch the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> movies.</p>

<p>No, I say, I don’t think I will.</p>

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">👀 Vague spoilers for <i>I Saw the TV Glow</i>.</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">ℹ️ Originally posted on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/neko_and_co/film/i-saw-the-tv-glow/5/">Letterboxd</a>, with a bit of added polishing for <b>catloaf &amp; coffee</b>.</div>

<p>Once one pushes past the initial fear, starting transition is exciting. It’s time to start hormones, buy new clothes, try a new hairstyle, learn makeup, and get a piercing or two. Eventually, though, some time passes and one has checked all those little boxes, and now there’s not much left to do but wait.</p>

<p>Five months into my transition, I’m feeling the lull set in. Of course, I can still work on my wardrobe and makeup skills and so on. But the initial rush of euphoria that comes along with all those “firsts” has come and gone. Now I’m left to slowly watch myself change in the mirror. It’s tough. I didn’t realize how heavily I’d been relying on the highs of that initial transition period, so as I move into this next phase of my transition, I’ve found myself feeling especially dysphoric. Many a day has gone by where I’m at the verge of tears at every hour of the day.</p>

<p>Frustrated and wanting to <em>do something</em> to further my progress, I was playing around with FaceApp’s feminization filter, hoping it would provide pointers on what I should focus on. (Yes, consulting an AI-powered filters app for tips on my transition is almost certainly a bad idea, but I was feeling desperate.) After feeding it a few pictures of myself from the past year, I came to a curious realization: in recent pictures, the filter barely touched my face at all and just gave me longer hair. But in pictures from the start of my transition, the filter changed my whole face. This made me feel a bit better about my progress. It helped me to see the genuinely substantial changes I’ve undergone in a mere five months. Of course, I’m still not anywhere near where I want to be—hell, the app itself assumes my gender as male—but it was nice to be able to recognize the progress I’ve made.</p>

<p>Even so, the filter’s recommendation was to grow my hair out longer. Fair enough. I’d already been considering doing so, however this meant more waiting around for things to happen… not exactly the brilliant action-packed plan I was hoping for.</p>

<p>I was feeling lost. I felt myself beginning to slip as doubt crept in. <em>You’ll never be a girl. You’ll always just be a dude in makeup.</em></p>

<p>I needed guidance, and there was only one place I could think of to go: <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>.</p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-beans.png" /></div>

<p>I pushed play. <em>Let’s go to church.</em></p>

<p>Two minutes into the runtime, a gym class parachute lined with white, blue, pink, and purple stripes billows through the air as <em>Anthems For A Seventeen Year-Old Girl</em> by yeule hums in the background. I can feel it hitting already. My face is scrunched up, I’m sniffling, tears running down my cheek. It’s an ugly sight, I’m sure, but no one is around. It’s just me, my cat plushie, and <em>TV Glow</em>.</p>

<p>Soon, Caroline Polachek sings of girls with makeup in <em>Starburned and Unkissed</em> as Owen strolls through his high school’s hallways. I’m losing it. In my first viewing, I cried here, too—albeit with far fewer tears, as I was emotionally stunted then. But tonight, with testosterone eradicated, my lips are wet and taste of salt. Tonight, <em>I am</em> one of the girls in makeup.</p>

<p>Ere long, it’s time for Maddy’s monologue, and I swear this is the greatest monologue ever committed to film and <em>I will fight anyone who says otherwise</em>. Maddy literally looks into the camera and says they pissed and shit their pants and it somehow works. I don’t understand <em>how</em> it works, only that it does. <em>Bravo</em>, Jack Haven.</p>

<p>(<em>For the steaming pile of dog shit that is</em> Emilia Pérez <em>to have been nominated for Best Picture and not this is perhaps one of the greatest travesties of our times. Then again, maybe no one should care about an award show that only started <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/22/nx-s1-5372650/oscar-voting-changes">requiring its judges to actually watch the films</a> they vote on after 97 whole-ass years. I digress.</em>)</p>

<p>(<em>Actually, one more thing. Did you know <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/zoe-saldana-emilia-perez-oscar-trans-1235131572/">Zoe Saldaña’s Oscar statue is trans</a>? It goes by they/them. Yes, the statue. Thank you, Zoe Saldaña, very cool. Next time you want to give a nod to the marginalized community that the film you won an award for centers around, try doing so in your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeCv6NyMveg">acceptance speech</a>. You know, the place where you’ll have the most eyeballs? I. Digress.</em>)</p>

<p>As Maddy delivers their speech in the planetarium, I feel something welling up inside of me. So many emotions. Fear? Hopelessness? Denial? No. Once, these were the things I felt in response to this film, but no longer. Tonight, I feel happy. Hopeful. Grateful for having seen this film and absorbed its teachings. Joyful for having finally discovered myself; for starting season six.</p>

<p>The tears are rushing down my face now. My nose is oozing down my upper lip, and I taste a rather off-putting concoction of salty tears and bitter mucus. My eyes feel swollen. I’m going through it, girl.</p>

<p>I start shaking. I can’t control it. I’m squeezing this plushie within an inch of its nonexistent life and I’m wildly shaking. In this moment, I feel Maddy’s every word. Every breath. Every step. This feeling is so intense I feel like I might burst. It’s overwhelming. I can barely handle it.</p>

<p>The monologue ends. My heart feels like it’s about to burst out of my chest but I slowly calm down.</p>

<p>Now Owen is screaming in the Fun Center’s party room. Last year, this scene shook me to my core. Tonight, I watch in sadness for Owen, but feel at ease knowing that I’ve spared myself this fate.</p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-beans.png" /></div>

<p>Words cannot begin to express how much this film means to me. I know because I’ve been trying to put its impact on me into words ever since I first saw this film back in October. I wrote an <a href="/2025/i-saw-the-tv-glow-and-it-terrified-me/">8,000 word personal essay</a> using <em>TV Glow</em> as a framework for my own coming out story, and much to my chagrin it completely fails at communicating the transcendent power this film holds for me. The English language simply doesn’t possess the verbiage—and I, the writing prowess—to convey these emotions.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, here I am trying to convey them yet again. Despite having seen <em>TV Glow</em> six times now and having poured over its script countless times when writing that aforementioned essay, this most recent viewing drew out an emotional response in me greater than ever before. Its magic isn’t fading. Not even a little.</p>

<p>I’m just… <em>so fucking happy</em> to be where I am now. I’m learning to love myself, and I owe it all to this film—to Jane Schoenbrun, to Jack Haven, to Justice Smith; everyone who made this work of art possible. This film birthed me a new life.</p>

<p><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> and trembled before God while she smiled back at me. Nothing was the same since.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">⚠️ Does this need a content warning? I don’t know. Listen honey, this piece is full of bitterness and resentment and hostility and a general disdain for any and all life. If you’re not in a good place to receive that, skip this one! And if you are in a good place, hey, maybe skip this one anyway! You’ve got better things to do, I promise.<br /><br />

And like, obviously this post isn’t safe for work, but if you clicked on a post titled “Sad Bitch Hour” thinking it’d be safe for work, who’s the clown here? It ain’t me, sister.</div>

<p>Sorry, what’s that?</p>

<p>How’s the transition going, you ask?</p>

<p>Oh girl, you want to know?</p>

<p>Are you sure?</p>

<p>You <em>really</em> want to know?</p>

<p>You <em>really, really</em> want to know?</p>

<p>Alright, I’ll tell you.</p>

<p>But just remember, <em>you asked for this</em>…</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to my waking nightmare.</strong></p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-beans.png" /></div>

<p>Ugh. Fuck, why? Why??</p>

<p>To my great displeasure, I have awoken in yet another day. Today it is Sunday, which means it’s the second part of this <em>wondrous</em> weekend I’m having. Yesterday was shit but maybe today will be better?</p>

<p>Of course it fucking won’t. It’s 2025, girl! We’re all rapidly plummeting toward the-world-as-we-know-it’s death and the brakes failed ages ago. It only gets worse from here. Welcome to the new normal. Put on your big girl panties.</p>

<p>(Or don’t actually, because you still have your male appendage so you sure as hell aren’t gonna fit in them.)</p>

<p>I pull out my phone and start my morning scroll. Yeah, yeah, doomscrolling is bad for you, but don’t worry I know what I’m doing because I heard about something called <em>exposure therapy</em> once.</p>

<p>I’m on reddit because I guess I hate myself, or maybe I have an unexplored masochism kink. Both are equally likely. My feed is comprised of cat photos, some whining about the <em>absolute state</em> of various video games, and a whole lot of trans-related posts. Posts like:</p>

<p><em>Someone called me Ms. at work and I really liked it, am I trans?</em></p>

<p><em>I want to cry every time I look in the mirror, what’s wrong with me?</em></p>

<p><em>I’m dating this girl who thought she was a lesbian until she met me and she says I’m not like other guys, what does this mean?</em></p>

<p><em>My boyfriend said I’ll never be a woman and called me a tranny, is he being transphobic?</em></p>

<p>God, this shit is like, <em>so 2024</em>. Bitch, you’re trans. The answer is always that you’re trans and you should break up with your boyfriend. Or something. Whatever. I don’t care.</p>

<p>Today, I do not care. Today, I regret waking up.</p>

<p>I think I’m at a low point in my transition, honestly. I’ve ticked off a lot of the easy boxes like buying new clothes, learning makeup, and getting my ears pierced. Now I’m left with the hard, not-so-fun, long-term stuff like laser hair removal (maybe one day I won’t be a broke bitch and can afford it) and voice training and growing my hair out and just fucking waiting around for hormones to do their thing. I can actually see the girl in the mirror now—whoop-de-fucking-doo—but it’s basically just a waiting game until I actually reach her.</p>

<p>And goddamn, haven’t I waited long enough? Get off your ass, girl! Why are you making me chase you? Meet me halfway, at least. Fuck.</p>

<p>I wallow in my misery underneath my weighted blanket for a while. I need to go into the city today to buy a business casual outfit—or “cool biz” as it’s known in Japan—for a conference on Tuesday. The only clothes I have that fit the bill are from pre-transition when I was bloated to all hell, and honey we can’t be having any of that now, can we?</p>

<p>Thinking about going out into public like <em>this</em> makes me want to die, though. So I present an incredible offer to my rational brain (RB): what about today’s shopping, <em>tomorrow</em>? That’s good. God, I’m so innovative. Steve Jobs should hire me.</p>

<p>Alright, it’s a stupid fucking idea, but it’s exactly the kind of stupid fucking idea that I’m currently prone to going along with, and sure enough RB falls for it. Ha, dumbass! Not even estrogen can vanquish the procrastinator within me.</p>

<p>I should probably actually do something with my day, though. I may be a sad bitch, but I at least have enough sense to realize that wallowing around in bed all day isn’t actually as intelligent of a plan as I might think. Get up, RB commands. Ugh. Just a few more minutes. Get the fuck up, RB screams. Fine, I’ll get up but you didn’t have to be a bitch about it. I was gonna get up anyway. Eventually.</p>

<p>I drag myself to the mirror and like, how the fuck do you think I feel about what I see? Dark bags under my eyes like I’m a drug addict, and two day’s worth of beard growth because I felt so gross yesterday that I couldn’t be fucked to even bother shaving. I mean, what’s even the point if I’m just going to look like a dude anyway? At best, maybe I can look like a fag, but you know that’s not really the reason I started transition, is it? No one had any problem with pinning me as a fag before I started transitioning, anyhow.</p>

<p>Whatever. Today, I don’t care about those things. Dysphoria? Ha, who’s she?</p>

<p>I step into the shower, which I’ve grown to have a very love/hate relationship with because I can look down at my feet and BEHOLD! <em>Tits!</em> … and a dick. Yes, this is what I am now. Somewhere between man and woman. A weird transsexual freak.</p>

<p>At least no one can tell if you’re crying when you’re in the shower. Haha!</p>

<p>Shower’s over and I’m feeling like maybe I should try actually combating my dysphoria by trying to look good, instead of just throwing on a depression hoodie like yesterday. I switch on my razor and get to shaving. Little cuts start to appear across my face because that’s just what happens when you shave, I guess? I mean, it’s 2025, you’d think we’d have a better way of shaving without destroying your face but I guess my face is just too sensitive, so fuck me. Better to look a little cut up than to have a beard? I guess?</p>

<p>????</p>

<p>While my face dries from that balm I slather all over my face in the hopes that it’ll prevent my face from turning bright red and bumpy after shaving, but in reality my face still turns red and bumpy only a little bit less so than without it, I look through my wardrobe. It’s really stupid. 70% of my clothes are from pre-transition and I treat them like they’re coated in the bubonic plague. Thing is, plenty of clothes in that 70% are still perfectly fine to wear, but nope. Can’t do it. Won’t do it. They have that filthy fucking boy stench all over them. Instead, I stick to my new clothes that don’t fit me right. You know, the ones designed for hips I don’t have? The ones that assume a bust I don’t have? The ones tailored without a cock in mind? Yes, those.</p>

<p>Last week, a friend asked me why don’t I ever wear a dress? Fair question. A dress wouldn’t have the bulge issue. Still, it’s not going to happen. You will never see me in a dress, I said, not for a very long time. Why not, they asked. I sighed and explained that if I put on a dress and look in the mirror and see a dude in a dress, I think I might just go postal.</p>

<p>If I’m going to try to combat my dysphoria today, I suppose I ought to choose something that’ll make me feel like not-a-dude. How about that skirt that I bought and vowed to never let a single other soul ever see me in because I have a crushingly pathetic sense of self-confidence? Well, I didn’t shave my legs today, so that’s out. Whatever, it’s Sunday and I’m not stepping foot outside. A cami and those pants I bought at H&amp;M that I got really excited about because <em>oh my god I’m wearing girl pants for the first time</em> and then subsequently <em>mortified</em> once I put them on again at home and saw a clear outline of my schlong—yeah, those’ll do. Who cares.</p>

<p>I return to the mirror and push play on my “<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ij9kJXUaQmQtFEdo3qnOW">Bad Girl Club</a>” playlist which is supposed to be affirming and empowering, but today it just feels like it’s mocking me for being bad at being a girl. Which, fair enough. I mean, I can’t really argue with that.</p>

<p>Time for makeup. I decide to try a darker eye shadow today to reflect all these capital-F “Feelings” swirling around inside of me, like I’m Robert Pattinson in <em>The Batman</em>, which is a very funny analogy because he is a boy and I am not really. I carelessly smear it over my eyelids and add in some eyeliner with a pen. I’ve never been very good with the pen and today is no exception but fuck it, it doesn’t matter because today I do not care.</p>

<p>Delilah Bon’s aggressively feminist <em>Dead Men Don’t Rape</em> blares out my speakers and girl, it’s a vibe. I don’t know if it’s a good one, but it’s definitely <em>a vibe</em>.</p>

<p>Finished, I look at myself in the mirror. My eye shadow is all over the place and it’s way too dark for my protruding eyebrow bone that already casts my eyes into shadow. My eyeliner looks like a five-year-old’s crayon disasterpiece that they did on the wall while Mommy wasn’t looking. I look like shit. <em>It’s perfect</em>.</p>

<p>Now’s the point in my morning routine where I take a selfie to document my transition. I tell myself this is a really good idea, but so far I’m not really convinced. It mostly just makes me feel worse about myself, if you can believe that, but yesterday I managed to take a photo so today certainly isn’t going to be the day when I fuck up my 150+ day streak. I put on my best bitchy face and flip off the camera, as a notification from the Associated Press pops down: <em>The U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear sites, Trump says, joining Israeli air campaign as Tehran promises to retaliate.</em></p>

<p>Yeah, sure, fuck it. Why not? Not like it’s a surprise, I mean we all knew this was going to happen as soon as Trump started talking in pluralities, right? And what’s another war, anyway? America’s kill count is like its financial debt: too fucking high for anyone to understand or give a shit about. Like, 30 trillion dollars? What does that even <em>mean</em>?</p>

<p>So fuck it, what’s a few more bodies, right? What’s more American than blood in the Middle East?</p>

<p>I’m firmly atheist, except for today. Today, I believe in Hell and I’m in it.</p>

<p><em>Hey Luci</em>, I say with a flirty wave.</p>

<p><em>Hey girlie,</em> he says. His horns look extra delicious today. Damn, he could <em>totally</em> hit, I mean, if he wanted to.</p>

<p><em>Bet you’re loving all this, huh, babe?</em></p>

<p><em>Girl, you don’t even know! That prick is bringing me so much business. We’re having to work overtime just to accommodate all these MAGA fucks!</em></p>

<p><em>That’s great, hun,</em> I say. <em>You gonna have my E ready for me this month?</em></p>

<p><em>Of course, of course,</em> he says with a hand wave. <em>What do you think I am, some kinda shady back alley dealer? I’ve never let you down.</em> He pauses and raises an eyebrow. <em>Assuming you’re good on quota this month?</em></p>

<p><em>Naturally. Wouldn’t dream of shorting you, my dear.</em></p>

<p>He smiles. <em>That’s my girl!</em></p>

<p>(All trans girls get their estrogen from Satan in exchange for spreading the trans agenda. You didn’t know that? Oh my god, that’s <em>so</em> embarrassing for you.)</p>

<p>I sit my bony ass down in front of my computer. What’s nice about the Internet is it makes it easy to hyper-focus, and then I get so absorbed into whatever it is that I’m doing that I start to meld with the 1’s and 0’s and I can leave behind my corporeal flesh. Lately, I’ve been feeling all sorts of emotions which is theoretically what I wanted when I started HRT, but then again maybe not like this? There was a weird, fucked up sense of peace in feeling numb all the time, at least.</p>

<p>Anyway, it doesn’t really matter because I’d sooner fucking die than go back to the way things were before. I still believe this, even if today I’d rather bury myself in the nearest rice paddy for a few years. Maybe the next few decades. It’d save everyone the trouble of digging me a grave. I’d probably be better at being fertilizer than a girl, anyhow.</p>

<p>So, I beg the Internet to bludgeon my senses until I’m a Pretty Girl. Except instead of playing a game or watching YouTube until my brain rots away, today I decide to write—an unusual decision, as I never write on the weekends. However, today I have Important Words that must be expressed. It’s <em>imperative</em> that the three people that read the things I write hear about-</p>

<p>Well actually, given the horrifying headline I just received on my phone, this isn’t important in the slightest. But what else am I, a sad bitch in her sadder apartment, going to do? No, today I write because fuck you.</p>

<p>I navigate to some pretentious blog with a cat in a coffee cup as its logo and start a new post. I give it some dramatic and slightly provocative title, and a subtitle containing a reference that most people probably won’t even get because I guess I like to see how far I can crawl up my own ass.</p>

<p>I’ll look at it later and roll my eyes, I’m sure.</p>

<p>But today, I do not give a fuck.</p>]]></content><author><name>sage-leaf</name></author><category term="trans" /><category term="featured" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The coup will be televised.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/the-coup-will-be-televised/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The coup will be televised." /><published>2025-06-19T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2025-06-19T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/the-coup-will-be-televised</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/the-coup-will-be-televised/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1557992260-ec58e38d363c?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=M3wzMDAzMzh8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwyfHxuZXdzJTIwZmlyZXxlbnwwfHx8fDE3NDk3ODU5NzF8MA&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;q=80&amp;w=1080" alt="man sitting on chair holding newspaper on fire" /></p>

<p>Corpses pile up in the Middle East, in 4K they’re caught<br />
Don’t you dare call it a genocide<br />
Lest you’re shipped off to CECOT</p>

<p>In Europe, drones buzz overhead<br />
Death following in their wake<br />
The world looks on and goes to bed<br />
Later donates to the cause for a tax break</p>

<p>Eleven slain in Graz<br />
Cold on the classroom floor<br />
There’s no just cause<br />
Never enough uproar</p>

<p>The Witch Queen sits upon her throne<br />
With a proud smirk and cigar in hand<br />
All the while the dolls groan —<br />
Just as planned</p>

<p>Airplanes falling from the sky<br />
We hebben een serieus probleem<br />
Blame it on DEI<br />
I’ll light the candelabrum</p>

<p>Bro’s got worms<br />
But he’s in charge of our health?<br />
Probably doesn’t even believe in germs<br />
(Or the commonwealth)</p>

<p>The leader of the free world perverts and goads<br />
While the spaceman grovels at his feet<br />
Oh dear, the girls have reached a crossroads!<br />
As protests erupt in the street</p>

<p>Ghouls prowl our neighborhoods, trying to look tough<br />
Looking for the scary brown men<br />
Or anyone close enough</p>

<p>Fires rage in the city of angels<br />
For the second time this year<br />
The media is taking all kinds of weird angles<br />
Should probably stick to the blogosphere</p>

<p>More blood for the Blood God<br />
Lights, camera, bitch, smile<br />
I’ll wait for you to applaud<br />
As the chain gang marches single file</p>

<p>Another casualty<br />
Time for another meme<br />
We treat everything so casually<br />
You can watch it all on a live stream</p>

<p>Blood on the pavement<br />
Gas in the air<br />
Mass displacement<br />
It’s fucking everywhere</p>

<p>Dreams soured<br />
Everything is in decline<br />
Feeling like a coward<br />
Six thousand miles away from the front line.</p>]]></content><author><name>sage-leaf</name></author><category term="poetry" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Photo by Nijwam Swargiary on Unsplash]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Humbly, I kneel before your altar.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/humbly-i-kneel-before-your-altar/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Humbly, I kneel before your altar." /><published>2025-06-12T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2025-06-12T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/humbly-i-kneel-before-your-altar</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/humbly-i-kneel-before-your-altar/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1727448826555-de5a31dc675a?q=80&amp;w=2340&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" alt="portrait of woman in art gallery" /></p>

<p>As the sun rises, so do I.<br />
Tired and weary, I drag myself to the altar<br />
hoping to meet my muse.<br />
Some days they readily greet me.<br />
Others, they are silent and unseen.</p>

<p>In her absence, I look elsewhere<br />
to false idols.<br />
Thinking, <em>that could be me</em>.<br />
But I’m left wanting,<br />
insufficient, always inadequate;<br />
never enough.</p>

<p>I should know better.<br />
Many a Sunday I heard the tale of the irreverent Nebuchadnezzar,<br />
his blasphemy an allegory<br />
for the pitfalls of a false ideology.</p>

<p>But what else am I to do when left to my own devices?</p>

<p>In these moments, disturbing thoughts obscure my vision.<br />
Hypotheticals, as my mind is wont to do.</p>

<p>What if this is it?<br />
What if this is all there is?<br />
What if this is all I am?<br />
Could I accept that?</p>

<p>I don’t think so.<br />
I have to be more.</p>

<p>O Lord, I don’t know who I am anymore.<br />
Once upon a time, I had a clear vision of who I thought I was<br />
but I fear it was merely a fantasy.</p>

<p>Am I a boy?<br />
Surely not!<br />
Am I a girl?<br />
Next question.</p>

<p>To love me is to undergo an overwhelming metamorphosis.<br />
Bravery and strength —<br />
these things demanded of me, yet I am wholly lacking.</p>

<p>I am not strong<br />
and I am not brave.<br />
I am fucking terrified.</p>

<p>I am nothing but meek and small<br />
despite my above-average frame,<br />
a cruel joke from an even crueler creator.</p>

<p>If I kneel at your altar and clasp my hands,<br />
will you light the way?</p>

<p>If I bow my head and surrender my worries,<br />
will you teach me the truth?</p>

<p>If I confess my sins and expel jealously from my heart,<br />
will you breathe life into this flesh?</p>

<p>I feel weaker than I’ve ever been,<br />
unsure if I can bear this weight until its destination.<br />
Sometimes I wish I could go back to the way things used to be —<br />
everything was simpler then.</p>

<p>But this I know to be true:<br />
willful ignorance may have been easy,<br />
but it was a product of the serpent’s conniving tongue.<br />
Nothing but Death awaited in that place.</p>

<p>Enshrouded in a thick gloom,<br />
faith is difficult to sustain.<br />
At times, it’s all I can do to stop myself from screaming.</p>

<p>Then I think about your teachings<br />
your awesome image<br />
your warm bosom —<br />
to be in your charge is to be loved<br />
and realize this has all been worth it.</p>

<p>In you, I entrust my everything.</p>]]></content><author><name>sage-leaf</name></author><category term="poetry" /><category term="trans" /><category term="featured" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Photo by Moutaman Kamal on Unsplash]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">38,880,000 seconds and counting.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/38880000-seconds-and-counting/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="38,880,000 seconds and counting." /><published>2025-06-05T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2025-06-05T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/38880000-seconds-and-counting</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/38880000-seconds-and-counting/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1551892644-51a6e2e8fc65?q=80&amp;w=994&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D" alt="taper candle on cupcake" /></p>

<p>Today is your birthday,<br />
although I will make no calls,<br />
send no texts,<br />
offer no gifts.</p>

<p>I’d like to,<br />
but we don’t talk anymore.</p>

<p>It’s been 450 days<br />
or 10,800 hours<br />
or 648,000 minutes<br />
since we last spoke.</p>

<p>I can’t pretend to understand what happened.</p>

<p>Was it something I said?<br />
Did I miss a critical social cue?<br />
Did I do something to offend you?</p>

<p>Or was it simply time for us to end?</p>

<p>I still think back to the time we spent together:<br />
the late night phone calls,<br />
the conversations about boys,<br />
the aimless strolls through the woods<br />
where the alligator lady dwelt.</p>

<p>I still think back to photosynthesis.</p>

<p>Of course,<br />
there were the arguments,<br />
and the bickering,<br />
and the accusations,<br />
and …</p>

<p>I cannot deny these past 450 days have been less complicated,<br />
less stressful,<br />
generally easier<br />
as result of your absence.</p>

<p>And yet, they’ve been all the more lonely.</p>

<p>Times are scary;<br />
are you well?<br />
We left off on a cliffhanger;<br />
are you married now?<br />
Did you finally get your own place?</p>

<p>Are you happy?<br />
I hope so.</p>

<p>I really do.</p>

<p>In our last conversation<br />
you lamented that I never seemed happy.<br />
But look at me now!<br />
I wish you were here to meet me —<br />
the real me.</p>

<p>You never had a chance to meet Sage,<br />
and that’s a shame.<br />
(for both of us)<br />
I think you would’ve liked her.</p>

<p>But maybe our separation was necessary for us to grow.<br />
Maybe we needed to shed the past<br />
to move forward in the present;<br />
maybe we were just collateral.</p>

<p>I wish things ended differently.<br />
I wish they never ended at all,<br />
but I would’ve settled<br />
for ending things on an amicable note.</p>

<p>Despite the biting words,<br />
the hurt feelings,<br />
the hole left in your wake;<br />
despite everything,<br />
I wish you well.</p>

<p>Happy birthday.</p>]]></content><author><name>sage-leaf</name></author><category term="poetry" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Photo by Angèle Kamp on Unsplash]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The mountains are beautiful this time of year.</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/the-mountains-are-beautiful-this-time-of-year/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The mountains are beautiful this time of year." /><published>2025-05-29T00:00:00+09:00</published><updated>2025-05-29T00:00:00+09:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/the-mountains-are-beautiful-this-time-of-year</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/the-mountains-are-beautiful-this-time-of-year/"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/images/loose/mountains.jpg" alt="a grassy field with mountains in the background" /></p>

<p>Spring has arrived and so have the birds,<br />
and the bees,<br />
and the flowers,<br />
and even the weeds.</p>

<p>Spring has arrived but my chest has not.<br />
Nor my hips,<br />
my posterior,<br />
or my libido.</p>

<p>Yes, spring has arrived but still She eludes me.</p>

<p>The mountains are beautiful this time of year.<br />
Towering high above our abode,<br />
keeping watch<br />
ever vigilantly.</p>

<p>If I had a million dollars, I’d quit my job<br />
and trek to one of their peaks.<br />
Seclude myself away while I grow,<br />
change,<br />
metamorphose.</p>

<p>If only for a few years, I’d like to live upon them.<br />
Away from all the people —<br />
enough time for everyone to forget Him;<br />
enough time for me to know to Her.</p>

<p>The mountains are beautiful this time of year.<br />
The clouds hang above so peacefully,<br />
gently drifting in the breeze,<br />
carefree.</p>

<p>I’d like to soar alongside them —<br />
high, high above.<br />
To spare myself the awkward moments,<br />
embarrassing encounters,<br />
and dirty looks.</p>

<p>To watch from above how to be a woman.<br />
To learn how to move,<br />
how to speak;<br />
how to be the person that I am,<br />
instead of the person I’m not.</p>

<p>The mountains are beautiful this time of year.<br />
Their slopes dotted with bristly trees,<br />
forever bathed in a deep shade.</p>

<p>So, too, is my face —<br />
veiled in an ever-present five o’clock shadow.<br />
But unlike the mountains,<br />
it is not pretty on me.</p>

<p>It is ugly and heinous.<br />
A reminder of this obscene birthright forced upon me.<br />
My captor —<br />
this body.<br />
It refuses to let go.</p>

<p>The mountains are beautiful this time of year, aren’t they?<br />
Their cerulean and verdant hues like brushstrokes<br />
from an unseen colossal artist.</p>

<p>I think of them as I paint in the mirror each morning.<br />
But I never turn out quite so beautiful<br />
as the mountains above.</p>

<p>I am enveloped in beauty,<br />
immersed in rich scenery.<br />
Yet so devoid of it in myself.</p>

<p>I’m trying.<br />
O, god, I’m trying!<br />
I’m doing my damnedest,<br />
but it feels like it isn’t enough.</p>

<p>The mountains are beautiful this time of year,<br />
and they intimidate me.</p>

<p>Will I ever compare?<br />
Could I ever harness their beauty?<br />
Is it conceited to desire such things?<br />
Do these musings make me a lesser person?</p>

<p>Indeed, the mountains are so beautiful this time of year.<br />
And I know you’re beautiful, too.<br />
Sometimes I catch glimpses of you.<br />
A trick of the light?<br />
Maybe,<br />
I’m delusional,<br />
or maybe,<br />
I’ve finally started to piece together who I really am;<br />
who you are —<br />
who We are.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to finally meet you<br />
in full,<br />
but I wish it could be under different circumstances.<br />
Simpler times.<br />
Safer times.<br />
I wish this could be our little secret —<br />
just you and me.<br />
With all the time in the world to ourselves,<br />
until we’re ready to reintegrate into society.</p>

<p>The mountains are so damn beautiful this time of year.<br />
I take them for granted, I know.<br />
I’m so focused on what could be,<br />
or what will be,<br />
or what was,<br />
I forget what is.</p>

<p>Those mountains?<br />
They’ve always been beautiful, truthfully.<br />
Just like you.<br />
You’ve always been there, just under the surface;<br />
waiting,<br />
waiting<br />
so patiently.</p>

<p>Thank you<br />
for not giving up;<br />
for clinging onto hope<br />
even when I had lost mine many years ago.</p>

<p>I’m here now, 
wrapped in the warm embrace<br />
of those beautiful mountains. ❤️</p>]]></content><author><name>sage-leaf</name></author><category term="poetry" /><category term="trans" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Somewhere, Nowhere, Japan]]></summary></entry></feed>
