  <h1>My face is clay, but I am a dreadful artist.</h1>
  <span class="fs-4 text-muted">2024.05.09</span>
  <div class="mt-4"><p>“When I first met you I thought you were an incel.”</p>

<p><em>What? Why the hell would you think that?</em></p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe it was the receding hairline.”</p>

<p><em>What does a hairline have to do with being an incel?</em></p>

<p>This wasn’t the first time a so-called “friend” recounted their not-so-great first impression of me, but this is certainly the worst (best?) example I can offer. I know this isn’t an unusual experience for people, because they tell me so:</p>

<p><em>“You seemed really pissed-off.”</em></p>

<p><em>“You looked a little scary.”</em></p>

<p><em>“I thought you were kind of a dick, at first.”</em></p>

<p><em>“You just seemed really uncomfortable.”</em></p>

<p>Okay, that last one is probably accurate.</p>

<p>When people tell me these things, my assumption is they are doing so in good faith, as a “fun” way to reminisce on the past, a chance to laugh with hindsight. Maybe I enable this behavior by smiling and laughing along, as if it is not-at-all hurtful and actually a <em>really funny</em> anecdote they’re telling me.</p>

<p>In actuality, it’s quite painful. Unfortunately, this is a recurring pattern. Most people I form some kind of friendly relationship with eventually tell me how unapproachable I once seemed.</p>

<p><em>“You’re not so bad once I got to know you, though!”</em></p>

<p>Growing up, I was constantly pestered by family, teachers, and peers: <em>What’s wrong? Smile! You look depressed. Are you not having any fun at all?</em> I eventually pieced together that these inquiries were often feigning concern, and were instead veiled attempts at telling me to look happier. My natural state made people uncomfortable, I suppose.</p>

<p>In my first week at university, the cashier at my dining hall told me I looked miserable. “Nah, I just have Resting Bitch Face,” I said, offering a meek smile. She laughed. I followed suit.</p>

<p>I don’t really like the term “Resting Bitch Face.” It’s rather rude. To use it in regard to myself feels very self-deprecating, and consequently invalidating. But it usually incites laughter and defuses awkward situations where someone has questioned why I’m <em>like that</em>, so I continue to use it because it’s easy. Do I want to explain that I have difficulty managing my facial expressions and moving in a way other people deem “normal” and “acceptable”? No, not really. Especially not to someone that thinks “Smile!” is an appropriate thing to say to a person.</p>

<p>It’s ironic that people find my face so offensive and my presence so intimidating, because in reality I’m quite inoffensive. I go to great lengths to make myself as invisible as possible; I’m practically a walking doormat:</p>

<p><em>What’s that? You want to me to do a big favor for you even though I barely know you and you have zero-intention of ever reciprocating? Absolutely! It’s my pleasure to serve.</em></p>

<p>No, I do not actually say those things, although sometimes I feel like I really ought to. Perhaps I’ve shaped my personality in a way to try to compensate for my. . . Resting Bitch Face. Of course, it isn’t my intention to appear scary, sad, or [<em>insert negative adjective here</em>]. I would love to appear enthusiastic, friendly, or non-threatening. However, my face does what it does. I can’t help it. I’ve tried.</p>

<p>I often visualize how I want my face to be. <em>In this moment, I want to look happy</em>, I tell myself. I picture my face in my mind and mold it like I’m a Renaissance artist according to the situation’s needs: the extent to which I should curl my lips upward, how open my eyes should be, where my eyebrows should lie. Once satisfied, I send off the image of the expression from my brain to be replicated by my face. Later, I imagine that expression again and observe it form in the mirror, and I’m met with frustration and disappointment as I watch my face barely move. It <em>feels</em> like it moved, and I even try to be a little <em>over</em>-expressive. Yet, I can clearly see the results, or lack thereof, staring back at me. It’s no wonder why people often feel intimidated by me. I honestly can’t blame them.</p>

<p>At some point in high school, I recognized this about myself. I decided it meant that I had a pretty good poker face, and I should use that to my advantage. I doubled-down on my stoic face and tried playing the “dark and mysterious” type, hoping I could intrigue people into wanting to be friends with me.</p>

<p>That didn’t work. I had the “dark” part down, but seriously lacked any intriguing mystery. Or, perhaps my peers just weren’t interested in playing <em>Detective with Sage</em>, in which case, fair enough.</p>

<p>Now, I’m in the back-half of my 20’s. I’ve mostly accepted that this is just how I am. I haven’t figured out how to present my face in a way that others find acceptable in two-and-a-half decades, and I probably never will.</p>

<p>Apparently people form their first impressions of someone in the first seven seconds or so. Is that actually true? I dunno. It sounds like one of those presumed-to-be-true facts that everyone passes around, is actually total bullshit, but no one can be bothered to look it up and see. Regardless, if it <em>is</em> true, I’m screwed. I’m forever going to be fighting an uphill battle against the preconceptions formed of me based off a quick glance or two. I guess I should hope that whatever meaning people read into my Resting Bitch Face isn’t <em>too</em> horrible.</p>

<p>…<em>incel</em>? Seriously?</p>
