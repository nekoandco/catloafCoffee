<p><em>The coffee shop was worn from the years, but had a quaint charm about it. Faded, mismatched seats rife with rips and tears were strewn about the space. Coffee notes wafted through the air, and the clinks of cups and plates reverberated around the wooden walls. A few customers had gathered in various corners, but the shop was mostly empty.</em></p>

<p><em>We approached the counter and gave our orders to a barista who relayed them to someone in the back. Then, we made our way to a quiet corner away from any would-be-eavesdroppers: two gaudy chairs and a small wooden table that had seen better days. As we waited for our orders to arrive, we made small talk.</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe Trump is gonna be president next month.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúYep.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúDid you hear about that shooting in New York? With the United guy?‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúMm. Yeah, the police are making a real good show of his arrest.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>After a time, a barista brought our coffees. I held my cappuccino with both hands, feeling its warmth spread from my palms and into my fingers and wrists. I took a deep breath. This was going to be a hard conversation. I wasn‚Äôt particularly optimistic toward its outcome, but it was a necessary discussion nonetheless. Today, those words I couldn‚Äôt say were going to be voiced, for better or worse.</em></p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-paws.png" /></div>

<p>It wasn‚Äôt by chance that I learned I‚Äôm Autistic when I did. I was struggling. I mean, I‚Äôve always been struggling, but I was <em>really</em> struggling. Even the most basic day-to-day tasks were posing a formidable challenge and all I could think of was release. Escape. Learning I‚Äôm Autistic when I did‚Äîwell, it likely saved my life.</p>

<p>I was diagnosed in February of last year, but I went into that diagnostic appointment already assuming I‚Äôm Autistic. I thought of it not so much as a diagnosis, but more as getting an expert to check my work. And I was right: the doctor didn‚Äôt have much trouble declaring me officially Autistic.</p>

<p>Prior to that diagnosis, I was cautious to fully admit I am Autistic for fear of using a label that I didn‚Äôt deserve. While I had learned quite a bit about Autism by that point already, I was hesitant to apply that knowledge to myself. What if I was wrong? What if I started using a framework of Autism on myself, only to find out later I was way off base? So, while in many ways I <em>knew better</em>, I intentionally refrained from lending myself grace by viewing myself through the lens of Autism‚Äîsomething that proved to be a bit of a mistake.</p>

<p>Two months before my diagnosis, I was on a plane from Japan to America. I flew from Narita to Dallas, and then from Dallas to Indianapolis. Originally, I was to take a direct flight but the airline had other plans. It was rough. The flights themselves were fine, but the whole travel experience was a challenge. There were the airport security agents barking orders‚Äî<em>they really don‚Äôt take kindly to those who have questions or need something repeated</em>‚Äîthe chaos of navigating a busy airport‚Äî<em>endless crowds and a constant barrage of loudspeaker announcements</em>‚Äîthe discomfort of being stuck on a plane for hours on end‚Äî<em>no privacy available except in a very unpleasant lavatory</em>‚Äîand airplane food that twisted my stomach in knots and made me want to cry.</p>

<p>By the time I finally reached the Indianapolis airport, I was in a sorry state. It felt like I was experiencing reality on a five-second delay, and I could barely form words. My family found me unresponsive, slumped in a corner near baggage claim. I could see them approach and say their greetings, yet I could not rouse myself to give an appropriate reaction.</p>

<p>As we walked to our rental car, my family members tried speaking with me‚Äîwe hadn‚Äôt seen each other in a year‚Äîbut they quickly gave up after receiving only a grunt or a half-hearted head shake.</p>

<p>It was scary. I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. Mentally, I was perfectly fine: I could think, process, and observe clearly. However, when it came to sending orders to my body‚Äî<em>move this way, say this thing</em>‚Äîmy muscles wouldn‚Äôt obey. It was as if I‚Äôd been drugged. I felt trapped in my own flesh.</p>

<p>It wouldn‚Äôt be until a few months later that I would recognize what I had experienced: a shutdown, specifically one that left me nonverbal. As I was explaining this to my family after the fact, one person told me, ‚ÄúI just thought you were really tired from the flight.‚Äù Another said, ‚ÄúI thought you were being rude.‚Äù</p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-beans.png" /></div>

<p><em>Count them: one, two, three. With each usage of my deadname, I cringed. It hurt. They knew better, and yet-</em></p>

<p><em>Oh, there‚Äôs another! Four. It‚Äôs difficult to believe in someone‚Äôs good intentions when they can‚Äôt even get one‚Äôs name right.</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúWe gave you your name. We called you ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà for years, until you decided you didn‚Äôt want to be called that anymore.‚Äù Five. Obviously, I didn‚Äôt expect perfection. But my 80-something grandfather immediately adopted my name without issue‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p><em>I took a sip of my coffee. This conversation was going nowhere fast. It was clear we were at a stalemate: my attempts at explaining myself were continuously shot down. Either they argued with the basic events that had occurred, or they accused me of being misleading or untruthful. I had previously explained that my tone of voice, facial expressions, and words shouldn‚Äôt be analyzed for hidden meaning, but they obviously hadn‚Äôt listened. Or cared?</em></p>

<p><em>They claimed to support me and my diagnosis, and yet‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p><em>It was now or never. It was time to read the letter.</em></p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-paws.png" /></div>

<p>I had hoped this most recent holiday would be better than the last. While 2023‚Äôs holiday felt like I was in a perpetual state of shutdown, I thought with my newfound understanding of myself and my limits, paired with my family‚Äôs awareness of my diagnosis, that my visit in 2024 would be different.</p>

<p>On Christmas Day, I sat among my family members, immersed in a sea of noise, lights, and movement. <em>It‚Äôs okay, I‚Äôve got this.</em></p>

<p>Before long, the noises grew louder, the lights bloomed brighter, and things moved ever more incomprehensibly. <em>Maybe I don‚Äôt ‚Äúgot this.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>It was too late. It all happened too fast‚Äîone moment I felt in control, and the next I was completely overwhelmed. For a time, I sat among everyone silent and frozen, unable to act. Eventually, I was able to force myself to retreat to another room.</p>

<p>I closed the door behind me and collapsed into a corner. A crumpled mess, I pulled at my hair, rocked back and forth, and sobbed. <em>Why am I like this?</em></p>

<p>It‚Äôs humiliating being like this. I‚Äôm the person no one worries about. I‚Äôm the one who said they would move to the opposite side of the globe and actually did it. I‚Äôm the person people tell me they can rely on. I have my shit together. I‚Äôm strong. I‚Äôm independent. I make things happen for myself.</p>

<p>But there I was, in a puddle of my own snot and tears because I couldn‚Äôt handle the holiday festivities.</p>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter that there are good reasons for why I am the way that I am. It doesn‚Äôt matter that I can use terms like <em>Autism</em> and <em>shutdowns</em> and <em>meltdowns</em> and <em>sensory sensitivities</em> and <em>Alexithymia</em> and <em>executive dysfunction</em> and <em>bottom-up thinking</em> and whatever else to explain myself. At the end of the day, I still look weak and pathetic to those around me.</p>

<p>Sure, they might say they understand, but they don‚Äôt. Not really. The ‚Äúnot understanding‚Äù isn‚Äôt what eats at me, though‚Äîit‚Äôs the subtle, unspoken disbelief in my disability. They‚Äôd never admit it‚Äînot directly‚Äîbut I can tell. <em>You don‚Äôt really believe that this hurts me.</em></p>

<p>The strong, independent, reliable, has-their-shit-together Sage? They aren‚Äôt real. They never were. They were only ever a figment of everyone‚Äôs collective imaginations; a front put up for everyone else‚Äôs benefit. But when I try to tear down that false version of myself; when I try to peel back the curtain and reveal‚Äî<em>surprise!</em>‚Äîit was all a sham? It‚Äôs like it doesn‚Äôt compute.</p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-beans.png" /></div>

<p><em>I finished reading the letter and sipped on my coffee. Silence. ‚ÄúSo, what do you think about that?‚Äù I asked.</em></p>

<p><em>They thought for a moment, then spoke, ‚ÄúI understand a lot more now. That puts things into perspective. Thank you for reading that.‚Äù I waited for something more‚ÄîI had told myself that I was going to read the letter purely for my own sake, and that I wasn‚Äôt going to expect anything more. But of course, I had secretly been hoping it would magically fix things.</em></p>

<p><em>It didn‚Äôt. Instead, it seemed to only tear us further apart. I had been as open, honest, and vulnerable as I could be. I had explained how they had abused and hurt me for years and years. Now here they were, saying they understood things. Yet, no apology or accepting of responsibility followed. Instead‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúYou know, Autism didn‚Äôt exist in the 80s.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>At first, I didn‚Äôt say anything. I was stunned. Surely, they had misspoke.</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ what? That‚Äôs absolutely not true,‚Äù I said in as even-toned a manner as I could manage.</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúNo one knew about Autism or understood it then,‚Äù they continued. ‚ÄúNow, everyone these days has something. I don‚Äôt know what happened to everyone with peanut allergies back then‚ÄîI guess they just died. But everyone‚Äôs got</em> something <em>now. Autism, ADHD‚Ä¶‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúAutism absolutely existed in the 80s,‚Äù I pushed back. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs easily verifiable.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúNo, Autism didn‚Äôt exist in the 80s,‚Äù they reiterated.</em></p>

<p><em>They were doubling down. They hadn‚Äôt misspoken.</em></p>

<p><em>‚Äú‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà, the world doesn‚Äôt care that you‚Äôre Autistic. It isn‚Äôt ever going to understand,‚Äù they said.</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. It isn‚Äôt ever going to understand,‚Äù I paused. ‚ÄúI just want to be understood by you.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>They sneered. ‚ÄúWell, you never understood</em> me.‚Äù</p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-paws.png" /></div>

<p>I‚Äôm hyper-independent out of necessity. It‚Äôs not something that I enjoy. Ask any hyper-independent adult if they like being as such and they‚Äôll almost certainly explain how it‚Äôs cripplingly lonely. Small things‚Äîsuch as getting a new piece of furniture‚Äîbecome herculean in nature when one can only rely on oneself. I didn‚Äôt <em>want</em> to be this way, but this is the only way that I‚Äôve been able to survive.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs easy to blame myself. It‚Äôs easy to say things like, ‚ÄúWell, you can‚Äôt expect anyone to help you if you never open yourself up to them,‚Äù or ‚ÄúIf you keep everyone at an arm‚Äôs length, what do you expect?‚Äù The thing is, I don‚Äôt think I have an issue with being vulnerable‚ÄîI‚Äôm more vulnerable on this <em>very public</em> blog than most people are vulnerable with themselves. On the contrary, perhaps my willingness to <em>be</em> vulnerable is what keeps people away‚Äîmaybe it‚Äôs too scary, too much. Or maybe it‚Äôs something else entirely.</p>

<p>Whatever the case, I‚Äôve learned from a plethora of personal experiences that the only person I can truly rely on is myself. Many have meant well, and I fully believe they really meant it when they said things like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for you,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI want to support you however I can.‚Äù Inevitably, it always becomes clear that I‚Äôm beyond their understanding, though.</p>

<p>I can‚Äôt blame them. I was beyond my own understanding for many years, but now that I‚Äôm starting to understand <em>why</em> I am, I‚Äôm met with the unpleasant realization that I <em>truly am</em> beyond many people‚Äôs understandings. Most will never <em>know</em> me. Maybe no one ever will.</p>

<p>The yearning to be understood is one that never rests. There‚Äôs an emptiness within me; a deep longing to <em>know</em> and be <em>known</em>. I hold to the hope that one day that empty space will be filled, but the more time that passes, the more difficult it is to seriously believe it will ever happen‚Äîor that it ever <em>could</em> happen.</p>

<p>And being the hyper-independent person that I am, it is <em>endlessly</em> frustrating to have something so core to one‚Äôs being be dependent on someone else. Try as I have, I can‚Äôt <em>make</em> anyone understand me. Maybe one day.</p>

<div class="break"><img src="/assets/images/break-beans.png" /></div>

<p><em>‚ÄúWell, you never understood</em> me.‚Äù</p>

<p><em>Those words hung in the air like a sick miasma. It was a baffling response. Perhaps it would‚Äôve been appropriate had the power dynamics of our relationship been remotely even, or if they hadn‚Äôt chronically verbally abused me since I was a child. But as things were, it was difficult to take such a statement seriously.</em></p>

<p><em>I defused, not wishing to start an argument. It was clear to me that this person wasn‚Äôt capable of owning up to their actions or engaging in serious discussion. It‚Äôs a strange feeling realizing one is more mature than someone twice their age. I started to pity them. They must live a miserable existence, believing everyone is against them.</em></p>

<p><em>I tried one last appeal: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still scared of you,‚Äù I confessed. ‚ÄúYou scare me.‚Äù</em></p>

<p><em>‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do anything about that,‚Äù they stated matter-of-factly.</em></p>

<p><em>That was it. The final nail in the coffin. There was nothing more I could do. I had no more petitions left, no more words to speak, no more strategies to employ. I had laid myself bare before them and the response I received was one of callousness. I couldn‚Äôt force them to listen.</em></p>

<p><em>Still, I knew they weren‚Äôt an evil person. They had good intentions at heart, but as the saying goes, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. They knew not of the pain they continually inflict, but that didn‚Äôt make it hurt any less.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I‚Äôm losing you. Or maybe I‚Äôve already lost you. Perhaps I lost you years ago and neither of us realized; now we‚Äôre like spirits carrying out our Earthly routines, blissfully unaware that we‚Äôre already dead. I suppose it doesn‚Äôt really matter now. What‚Äôs done is done.</p>

<p>Our love language seems to be one of hurting one another. Each interaction we share is characterized by the pain it inflicts. I‚Äôm not sure what the point is of continuing our interactions. I think we feel obligated to do so because of our relation to one another, but that‚Äôs silly.</p>

<p>Of this, I am 100% certain: this isn‚Äôt healthy. This is wrong. There is not, nor has ever been, a single person on this planet that makes me feel as negatively as you do.</p>

<p>You‚Äôre bad for me, or I‚Äôm bad for you, or we‚Äôre bad for each other‚Äîit hardly matters anymore. I had hoped for a positive resolution, but in hindsight, that was na√Øve of me. You‚Äôve never listened‚Äîto me or anyone else‚Äîso why would you start now?</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not angry with you. Not anymore. I was for a very long time because I couldn‚Äôt comprehend how you could continue to do and say these things to the ones you claim to love more than anything else. But I understand you now.</p>

<p>You really believe you‚Äôre in the right. That the world and everyone in it is against you. That all those people over the years that rejected you‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt do so because they didn‚Äôt like how you acted or spoke around them. No, they were just bullies. <em>You really believe you‚Äôre the victim.</em></p>

<p>Maybe you‚Äôre right. Maybe myself and all those other people are wrong. We‚Äôre just bad people, out to get you. It‚Äôs unlikely. It‚Äôs almost certainly a very simplistic perspective. But <em>maybe</em> you‚Äôre right.</p>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. What‚Äôs done is done.</p>

<p>I will be just another villain in your story. You‚Äôll tell other people about what a mean person I am. How I can‚Äôt handle conflict. How I have a lot of growing up to do. How I see the worst in everything. How I‚Äôm wrong and you‚Äôre right. How I hate you, and that‚Äôs that.</p>

<p>It doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. It‚Äôs over now.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt like seeing you this way, for so many reasons. I can feel the pain you hold within you. It‚Äôs no way to live. I hope that one day you can wake up and face reality. That you can be rid of all the anger inside you. That you can start to heal. That you can be happy for once.</p>

<p>But don‚Äôt expect me to welcome you back with open arms. I‚Äôm letting you go.</p>
