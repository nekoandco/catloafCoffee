## Hi, I’m Sage and this is my blog.

I’m a transfem twenty-something living abroad in Japan. The past couple of years have been a whirlwind: I was diagnosed Autistic at the start of 2024, and began my transition at the start of 2025. As one might expect, those two events have completely altered how I view myself, my life; the world, and my place in it. catloaf & coffee is my place to write as I process and learn more about myself and neurodivergence.

### What catloaf & coffee is:
- A record of processing an Autism diagnosis received in adulthood and transitioning in 2025.
- Writing intended to reflect neurodivergent thought processes.
- An inherently deep personal exploration of myself. Naturally, sometimes topics get pretty heavy—you’ve been warned. I’ll put content warnings before the really heavy stuff, though.
- One story of one Autistic and trans person. There are many (wildly varying) stories of such experiences—this is mine.

### What catloaf & coffee isn’t:
- A super-accurate resource on Autism or being transgender. I’ve probably gotten some things wrong already, and I’ll surely get some things wrong in the future. Our knowledge of these topics is rapidly evolving, anyhow. I’m doing my best, okay?
- An up-to-date record of my thoughts on various topics. I fully expect that I will come to disagree with things I’ve written, and that’s okay. Each post is only representative of my thoughts and feelings from when I wrote them.
- Concise. I intentionally leave in tangents and use an irresponsible amount of em-dashes on catloaf & coffee to reflect how my brain actually works/thinks/processes.
- Written for anyone but myself. The writing I do here is to help myself process. If someone decides to read along, that’s great! But, the goal is not to build an audience. I don’t feel satisfied if I leave all my writing stagnating on a hard drive somewhere, so I self-publish here.
