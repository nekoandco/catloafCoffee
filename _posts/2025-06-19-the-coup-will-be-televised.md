Corpses pile up in the Middle East, in 4K they’re caught  
Don’t you dare call it a genocide  
Lest you’re shipped off to CECOT  

In Europe, drones buzz overhead  
Death following in their wake  
The world looks on and goes to bed  
Later donates to the cause for a tax break  

Eleven slain in Graz  
Cold on the classroom floor  
There's no just cause  
Never enough uproar  

The Witch Queen sits upon her throne  
With a proud smirk and cigar in hand  
All the while the dolls groan —  
Just as planned  

Airplanes falling from the sky  
We hebben een serieus probleem  
Blame it on DEI  
I’ll light the candelabrum  

Bro’s got worms  
But he’s in charge of our health?  
Probably doesn’t even believe in germs  
(Or the commonwealth)  

The leader of the free world perverts and goads  
While the spaceman grovels at his feet  
Oh dear, the girls have reached a crossroads!  
As protests erupt in the street  

Ghouls prowl our neighborhoods, trying to look tough  
Looking for the scary brown men  
Or anyone close enough  

Fires rage in the city of angels  
For the second time this year  
The media is taking all kinds of weird angles  
Should probably stick to the blogosphere  

More blood for the Blood God  
Lights, camera, bitch, smile  
I’ll wait for you to applaud  
As the chain gang marches single file  

Another casualty  
Time for another meme  
We treat everything so casually  
You can watch it all on a live stream  

Blood on the pavement  
Gas in the air  
Mass displacement  
It’s fucking everywhere  

Dreams soured  
Everything is in decline  
Feeling like a coward  
Six thousand miles away from the front line.
