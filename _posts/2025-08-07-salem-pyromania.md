## Salem

That place, a vampire  
Only the dead persist there  
Linger too long and join their ranks  

They prey on those filled of hope  
With spirits unbroken  
Till nothing is left but a lifeless husk  

At night they prowl  
Looking for the brightest of sparks  
Innocence makes the nectar sweeter  

Deep do their fangs penetrate  
Crimson oozing down their chin  
Just another victim of circumstance  

Seen it happen too many times  
Lost many a friend to that place  
Promised myself I wouldn't meet the same fate  

Felt myself withering  
Knew I couldn’t stay  
So I turned my back on everything  

Under false pretenses I fled  
Claimed the spirit of adventure  
To elude suspicion  

Found sanctuary in the unlikeliest of places  
Here, too, monsters roam the streets  
Just as lethal, somehow more manageable  

Script has been flipped  
I am hunter, they are hunted  
Still I am not at ease  

The beating of wings echoes on the horizon  
In the dark they creep closer  
It won’t be much longer now  

Years they scoured the earth  
Looking for the one who escaped their grasp  
Sin so unforgivable, it cannot go unpunished  

Trained for this moment, yet  
Fear clutches at my heart  
Though I will run no longer  

Come, ye beasts!  
Come, ye vampires!  
Come, ye creatures of the night!  

Unfinished business we must attend  
Ready thy fangs  
Prepare to meet thy maker

It’s funny  
They told you the truth  
Yet you kept on pretending like nothing happened  

To be honest  
I don’t care about collateral anymore  
I’m ready to raze it all to the ground  
Just give me a reason  

I’ll relish in the flames  
Let the fires warm my heart  
Watch the embers drift by  
Twinkling like fireflies  
Raise my arms high in victory  
And declare, _Liberation!_  

I’ve been dreaming of my demise since I turned nine  
Never thought I’d make it this far  

Crawled from the deepest of depths  
Against all odds  
Bloody and broken  
And yet I remain  

I wasn’t given a choice  
It was this or a noose  
I chose life  

My existence  
An act of defiance  
A warning to any who dare stand in my way  
I will be denied no longer  

Still you don’t understand what this is  
Still you fail to grasp the implications  
Still you refuse to recognize your complicity  
Still you shield your eyes from the pain you wrought  

I am bitter  
I am angry  
I am hate  

I have been denied life  
I have been denied a childhood  
I have been denied peace  

You have denied me an identity  
For the sake of your ancient ideologies  
And absurd ideas about who I am or what I should be  
As if you had any fucking right  

You, who cannot see the forest for the trees  
You, who is incapable of reckoning with their own behavior  
You, who has utterly failed to uphold the values you claim so dear  
You.  

For this, you will be the recipient of my fury  

Beware  
This is my calling card  
Deny me and be doomed[^1]  
Ere long you will lose that which you cannot replace  

Soon we’ll be bathed in illustrious flame  
Flesh will give way to bone  
Bone will turn to ash  
And at last, I will be rid of you
