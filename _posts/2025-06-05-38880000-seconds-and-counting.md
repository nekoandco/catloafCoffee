Today is your birthday,  
although I will make no calls,  
send no texts,  
offer no gifts.  

I’d like to,  
but we don’t talk anymore.  

It’s been 450 days  
or 10,800 hours  
or 648,000 minutes  
since we last spoke.  

I can’t pretend to understand what happened.  

Was it something I said?  
Did I miss a critical social cue?  
Did I do something to offend you?  

Or was it simply time for us to end?  

I still think back to the time we spent together:  
the late night phone calls,  
the conversations about boys,  
the aimless strolls through the woods  
where the alligator lady dwelt.  

I still think back to photosynthesis.  

Of course,  
there were the arguments,  
and the bickering,  
and the accusations,  
and …  

I cannot deny these past 450 days have been less complicated,  
less stressful,  
generally easier  
as result of your absence.  

And yet, they’ve been all the more lonely.  

Times are scary;  
are you well?  
We left off on a cliffhanger;  
are you married now?  
Did you finally get your own place?  

Are you happy?  
I hope so.  

I really do.  

In our last conversation  
you lamented that I never seemed happy.  
But look at me now!  
I wish you were here to meet me —  
the real me.  

You never had a chance to meet Sage,  
and that’s a shame.  
(for both of us)  
I think you would’ve liked her.  

But maybe our separation was necessary for us to grow.  
Maybe we needed to shed the past  
to move forward in the present;  
maybe we were just collateral.  

I wish things ended differently.  
I wish they never ended at all,  
but I would’ve settled  
for ending things on an amicable note.  

Despite the biting words,  
the hurt feelings,  
the hole left in your wake;  
despite everything,  
I wish you well.  

Happy birthday.
