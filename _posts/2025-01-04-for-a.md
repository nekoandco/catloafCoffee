title: "For A."

I’m watching you wither,  
slowly, so slowly.  

I’m powerless to stop it.  

I can do nothing but watch,  

hope,  

pray,  

that I’m wrong.  

That you’re not dying.  

That soon the world will see you for what you truly are:  

_Strong._

_Brave._

_Kind._

_Beautiful._

But I fear one day I’ll stop receiving messages from you.  

And then I’ll know,  
you’ve finally,  

finally,  

found peace.  

I love you dearly.
